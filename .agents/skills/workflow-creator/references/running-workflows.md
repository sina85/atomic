# Running a Workflow on Behalf of the User

When the user asks you to **run** (or "kick off" / "start" / "execute") a
workflow — *not* author one — your job is to translate their request into the
correct invocation and run it. This is the playbook for that flow. It is
different from the authoring playbook in `SKILL.md`: the workflow already
exists in a registry; you just need to invoke it correctly.

**This playbook works from any context.** Whether you're running in a fresh terminal, inside `atomic chat -a <agent>`, or from a CI script, the decision tree below is the same — atomic builtins, repo examples, and user SDK workflows are all discoverable and invokable. If the user is chatting with you through `atomic chat` and says "start my hello-world workflow", walk the same three paths; the shared tmux socket means the workflow you spawn will be visible to every monitoring surface (the worker CLI's own `status` / `session` subcommands, `atomic workflow status`, and `bunx atomic …`) regardless of which path you used to start it.

## Three invocation paths

**Path A — user's own app.** The user wrote one or more composition
roots. Two shapes exist — pick based on what the file calls:

- **Single-workflow worker** (`runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })`) —
  one file per agent, bound to one `WorkflowDefinition`. The dev wires
  `--<input>` Commander options for each declared input using
  `getInputSchema(wf)`. Typical name: `claude-worker.ts`.

  ```bash
  bun run src/claude-worker.ts --<field>=<value>      # structured inputs
  bun run src/claude-worker.ts "<prompt>"             # positional (if the worker wired [prompt...])
  ```

  For detached runs, the dev passes `detach: true` to `runWorkflow` or
  wires their own `--detach` Commander option. There are no built-in
  `-n`/`-a`/`-d` flags on user-app workers.

- **Multi-workflow CLI** (`createRegistry()` + `listWorkflows`) —
  a single file that registers many workflows and mounts one Commander
  subcommand per workflow. The subcommand name is the workflow name; each
  subcommand's options are the workflow's declared inputs.

  ```bash
  bun run src/cli.ts <workflow-name> --<field>=<value>
  bun run src/cli.ts <workflow-name> "<prompt>"       # if the subcommand wires [prompt...]
  ```

**Path B — repo-shipped examples.** Inside the Atomic repo each example
directory ships one worker file per agent (`claude-worker.ts`,
`copilot-worker.ts`, `opencode-worker.ts`). Each is a Commander entrypoint
built with `getInputSchema(wf)`:

```bash
bun run examples/<name>/claude-worker.ts --<field>=<value>
bun run examples/<name>/copilot-worker.ts "<prompt>"    # if the worker wires [prompt...]
```

Available examples: `hello-world`, `parallel-hello-world`, `headless-test`,
`hil-favorite-color`, `hil-favorite-color-headless`, `structured-output-demo`,
`reviewer-tool-test` (copilot only). Use these to demonstrate a specific SDK
feature or as a copy-paste starting point.

**Path C — atomic builtins.** Workflows shipped inside `@bastani/atomic-sdk`
and registered via `createBuiltinRegistry()` inside the `atomic` CLI:

```bash
atomic workflow -n <name> -a <agent> [inputs...]
atomic workflow list
```

Builtin names: `ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`, `open-claude-design`.

Direct `atomic workflow` runs should always include `-n <name>` and
`-a <agent>`. Use `-d` when launching from an agent or script and you want
the command to return after spawning the workflow.

**Identify the path before anything else.** Decision order:

1. Is the name one of the three builtins (`ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`,
   `open-claude-design`)? → **Path C** (`atomic workflow`).
2. Does `examples/<name>/<agent>-worker.ts` exist in the current repo? →
   **Path B** (`bun run examples/<name>/<agent>-worker.ts`).
3. Does a composition root exist in `src/` (single-workflow
   `runWorkflow({ workflow })` file, or a cli `createRegistry()` + `listWorkflows`
   file)? → **Path A**.
4. None of the above → the workflow doesn't exist. Offer to author it
   (see below).

## Always list first

**Before running, list available workflows.** This is a cheap, read-only
call that confirms whether the named workflow actually exists:

```bash
# Atomic builtins
atomic workflow list

# Repo-shipped examples (when inside the atomic repo)
bun run examples/<name>/<agent>-worker.ts --help

# User's own app with an explicit list/help command
bun run src/cli.ts list
```

If the user app has no read-only list/help command, inspect its composition
root instead of running `-n <name> -a <agent>` as a probe — that would start
the workflow when the name is valid.

The list/help output or source inspection tells you:
- Whether the workflow the user named actually exists.
- What other workflows are available (close matches for typos).

Skipping this step is how you end up with a `workflow not found` error you
could have predicted.

If the request is ambiguous ("run the research one"), show the list to the
user and ask with AskUserQuestion.

## If the workflow doesn't exist: offer to create it

When the listed workflows don't include what the user asked for:

1. **Tell the user explicitly** — "I don't see a `<name>` workflow registered.
   Available: \<short list>."
2. **Check for typos first** — if one of the listed names is a close match,
   surface it via AskUserQuestion ("Did you mean `<close-match>`?") before
   offering to author anything.
3. **Offer to create it** — ask with AskUserQuestion: "Want me to create a
   `<name>` workflow first?" with choices `Yes, create it` / `No, pick from
   the list` / `No, cancel`.
4. **If yes → switch modes** — hand off to the authoring flow in SKILL.md.
   Interview the user for intent, write the workflow definition, register it
   in the composition root, typecheck it, *then* come back here and invoke.
   Do not skip the typecheck.
5. **If no → stop** — don't fabricate a command that will fail. Let the user
   redirect you.

Never invent a workflow name or silently fall back to a different workflow.

## Collecting inputs with AskUserQuestion

Once you've confirmed the workflow exists, you need to know two things about
its invocation shape:

1. **Does it declare a `prompt` input?** If so, it's free-form — you pass a
   positional string.
2. **Does it declare structured inputs?** If so, you pass `--<field>=<value>`
   flags, one per required field.

**Use `atomic workflow inputs <name> -a <agent>` to get the schema for atomic builtins.** This prints a JSON envelope with every field's `name`, `type`, `required`, `default`, `description`, and (for enums) `values` — exactly what AskUserQuestion needs. The `freeform: true` flag tells you whether the workflow takes a positional prompt vs. structured flags, with a synthetic `prompt` field included so the JSON shape is uniform either way.

```bash
atomic workflow inputs gen-spec -a claude
# {"workflow":"gen-spec","agent":"claude","freeform":false,
#  "inputs":[{"name":"research_doc","type":"string","required":true,...},
#            {"name":"focus","type":"enum","values":["minimal","standard","exhaustive"],"default":"standard"}]}
```

For user apps, read the workflow definition's `inputs` array directly or
inspect the TypeScript source — the schema is inline in `defineWorkflow({
inputs: [...] })`. Reading the source is always in sync because `defineWorkflow`
validates the schema at definition time.

`atomic workflow inputs` is a builtin-only command — it queries the
internal builtin registry and is not available for user apps. For user
app workflows, always read the `defineWorkflow` source directly.

Once you have the schema, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to collect any
values the user hasn't already provided in their message. One question per
missing input field. For enum fields, pass the declared `values` as
multiple-choice options so the user sees exactly what's allowed. Keep
questions tight and purposeful — if the user's message already answers a
question, don't ask it again.

Skip AskUserQuestion entirely when:
- The user already supplied every required value in their message
  ("run ralph on 'add OAuth to the API'" — the prompt is right there).
- The workflow declares no required inputs and needs no prompt.

## End-to-end recipe

1. **Identify the invocation path** — atomic builtin (`atomic workflow`),
   repo-shipped example (`bun run examples/<name>/<agent>-worker.ts`), or
   the user's own app (single-workflow `src/<agent>-worker.ts` or
   multi-workflow `src/cli.ts`)?
2. **List available workflows** — run the list command for the chosen path.
   This is your ground truth.
3. **Resolve the target**:
   - Exact match in the list → continue.
   - Close match → confirm via AskUserQuestion before proceeding.
   - No match → tell the user what's available and offer to author it (see
     previous section). If they decline, stop.
4. **Discover the inputs schema** — for builtins use `atomic workflow inputs
   <name> -a <agent>`; for user apps inspect the `defineWorkflow` source.
5. **Ask for missing inputs** — use AskUserQuestion, one question per
   unanswered required field. Enums become multiple-choice.
6. **Invoke** — build one of these commands:

   User's own app — single-workflow worker:
   - Free-form: `bun run src/<agent>-worker.ts "<prompt>"` (only if the worker wires `[prompt...]`)
   - Structured: `bun run src/<agent>-worker.ts --field1=val1`
   - Detached: pass `detach: true` to `runWorkflow` or use the dev's own `--detach` option

   User's own app — multi-workflow CLI:
   - Free-form: `bun run src/cli.ts <workflow-name> "<prompt>"` (only if wired)
   - Structured: `bun run src/cli.ts <workflow-name> --field1=val1`
   - Detached: same as above (dev-wired `--detach` or `detach: true`)

   Repo-shipped example (inside atomic repo):
   - Free-form: `bun run examples/<name>/<agent>-worker.ts "<prompt>"` (only if wired)
   - Structured: `bun run examples/<name>/<agent>-worker.ts --field1=val1`

   Atomic builtins:
   - Free-form: `atomic workflow -n <name> -a <agent> "<prompt>"`
   - Structured: `atomic workflow -n <name> -a <agent> --<field1>=<value1>`
   - Detached: add `-d`

7. **Tell the user how to attach interactively** — the runtime printed a
   session name like `atomic-wf-claude-<workflow>-a1b2c3d4`. Immediately
   echo it back with the **new-terminal attach instruction** described in
   §"After starting: tell the user how to view it interactively" below.
   This is non-negotiable on every successful spawn. Also surface
   `atomic workflow status <sessionId>` (poll) and
   `atomic session kill <sessionId> -y` (stop).
8. **If you started the workflow detached (`-d` or `detach: true`), poll
   status until it terminates or pauses for input** — see "Polling rhythm
   after spawning" below. Surfacing a HIL pause to the user immediately is
   non-negotiable; an unattended `awaiting_input` / `needs_review` state
   means the workflow is wedged and the user doesn't know.

## After starting: tell the user how to view it interactively

**Rule:** Every time you successfully start a workflow on the user's behalf, your *very next message* must tell them how to attach to it interactively **from a new terminal**. Do not bury this in a status report or a summary — it is the headline of the post-spawn message.

The runtime prints a session name when the workflow starts (e.g. `atomic-wf-claude-ralph-a1b2c3d4`). Capture that exact string and use it verbatim — do not paraphrase, abbreviate, or invent placeholder ids. The user must be able to copy-paste the command.

**Phrasing template** — substitute `<name>` with the workflow name and `<sessionId>` with the literal session id printed by the CLI:

> Started workflow `<name>` (session id: `<sessionId>`). To watch it run interactively, **open a new terminal** and run:
>
> ```
> atomic workflow session connect <sessionId>
> ```

**Why "open a new terminal" is part of the rule, not optional flavor:**

`atomic workflow session connect` attaches stdin/stdout to the workflow's tmux pane and takes over the terminal it runs in. If the user runs it in the same shell that's currently hosting their chat with you, they lose the chat session for the duration of the attach. A *second* terminal lets the workflow run visibly while the user keeps talking to you. Always say "open a new terminal" — never just "run this command."

**Use `atomic workflow session connect`, not `atomic session connect`.** Both reach the same tmux socket, but the `workflow` form is the canonical surface for workflow-spawned sessions and is what users will see in docs, examples, and other agent output. Stay consistent.

**This rule applies to all three invocation paths.** Builtins, repo-shipped examples, and user-app workers all land on the same `atomic` tmux socket, so `atomic workflow session connect <sessionId>` works regardless of how the workflow was spawned. Never use a path-specific attach command instead.

**Worked phrasing — copy this shape verbatim, swapping the ids:**

> Started workflow `gen-spec` (session id: `atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4`). To watch it run interactively, open a new terminal and run:
>
> ```
> atomic workflow session connect atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4
> ```
>
> Status: `atomic workflow status atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4`
> Stop: `atomic session kill atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4 -y`

If the runtime did *not* print a session name (rare — usually a startup error), do not fabricate one. Tell the user the workflow failed to start and surface the actual error output instead.

## Polling rhythm after spawning

When the workflow runs detached (you spawned it with `-d` or the user wants
to keep working while it executes), the model is responsible for tracking
its progress. The pattern is a small loop around `atomic workflow status`:

```bash
atomic workflow status <session-id>
# JSON envelope; key field is `overall`:
#   in_progress    → keep polling at a sensible cadence
#   awaiting_input → surface to user *now* — see HIL response below
#   needs_review   → surface to user *now* — same handling
#   completed      → report success + summarize the snapshot's `sessions[]` results
#   error          → report `fatalError` + offer to investigate
```

Polling cadence: every 30–60s for runs that should take minutes; every 2–5
minutes for long runs (e.g. `ralph` iterating). Don't busy-poll. If the
user asks "is it done yet?" mid-run, run `status` once and answer from the
result — don't kick off a new poll loop on every question.

### What to do on `awaiting_input` or `needs_review`

These states mean a stage is waiting on a typed answer (an `AskUserQuestion`
elicitation, a Copilot `ask_user`, an OpenCode `question.asked`, or a
review-marker handoff). The workflow will sit forever unless the user
responds.

The current send-back path is **interactive attach only**:

```bash
atomic workflow session connect <session-id>
# user lands inside the tmux pane, types their answer into the agent's TUI,
# detaches with the agent's standard binding (Ctrl-b d for tmux)
```

There is **no `atomic workflow send <id> --message "..."`** today — the
agent CLI panes accept input only through the live TUI. If the model needs
to forward a typed answer back into a session non-interactively, that's a
known gap; surface it to the user and let them attach. (The SDK does use
`tmux send-keys` internally for orchestration, but there is no public CLI
surface that exposes it for HIL responses.)

So when you see `awaiting_input` or `needs_review`:

1. Stop polling.
2. Read the snapshot's `sessions[]` to find which stage is paused (`status: "awaiting_input"`).
3. Tell the user **plainly and immediately**: "Workflow `<name>` is paused on stage `<stage-name>` waiting for your input. Attach with `atomic workflow session connect <session-id>` to respond." Include the stage name so the user knows what they're answering.
4. Wait for the user to confirm they've responded (or for the next status poll to show `in_progress` again) before resuming the polling rhythm.

### Inspecting on-disk state with `atomic workflow read`

When the model needs to actually *read* what a workflow has produced —
the saved transcript of a stage, the orchestrator's `status.json`, the
captured `inbox.md` rendering — `atomic workflow read` resolves the
on-disk path under `~/.atomic/sessions/<runId>/` so you don't have to
guess the opaque `<stageName>-<8hex>` directory suffix.

Two shapes:

```bash
# Run-level: list the run dir and discover available stages.
atomic workflow read --sessionId atomic-wf-claude-ralph-a1b2c3d4
# Inside an atomic chat session this auto-defaults to JSON:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "runId": "a1b2c3d4",
#   "path": "/home/u/.atomic/sessions/a1b2c3d4",
#   "stages": ["scout", "explore", "synth"],
#   "files": [{"name":"status.json","kind":"file","size":1234}, …]
# }

# Stage-level: resolve the single stage subdir + list its saved artifacts.
atomic workflow read --sessionId atomic-wf-claude-ralph-a1b2c3d4 --stageId scout
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "runId": "a1b2c3d4",
#   "stageName": "scout",
#   "path": "/home/u/.atomic/sessions/a1b2c3d4/scout-9f8e7d6c",
#   "files": [
#     {"name":"messages.json","kind":"file","size":8123},   ← s.save() raw JSON
#     {"name":"inbox.md","kind":"file","size":3401},        ← human-readable transcript
#     {"name":"metadata.json","kind":"file","size":312}
#   ]
# }
```

**Key fields under `<runId>/`:**

| File / dir                                     | What's in it                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status.json`                                  | Live panel snapshot — same JSON `atomic workflow status <id>` returns                                                                |
| `metadata.json`                                | Workflow-level metadata: name, agent, prompt, project root, `startedAt`                                                              |
| `orchestrator.log`                             | Stdout/stderr of the orchestrator pane                                                                                                |
| `<stageName>-<stageSessionId>/messages.json`   | The `SavedMessage[]` array produced by `s.save(...)` calls in that stage. Schema is provider-specific.                               |
| `<stageName>-<stageSessionId>/inbox.md`        | A plain-text rendering of `messages.json`. Cheaper to read than the JSON when you just want to see what the agent said.              |
| `<stageName>-<stageSessionId>/metadata.json`   | Stage metadata: name, description, agent, paneId, `startedAt`                                                                         |
| `<stageName>-<stageSessionId>/error.txt`       | Present **only** when the stage failed; contains the error message.                                                                  |

**Typical model flow** when investigating a stalled or completed run:

1. `atomic workflow status <session-id>` — see overall + per-stage states.
2. Pick a stage of interest (`needs_review` / `error` / `completed`).
3. `atomic workflow read --sessionId <session-id> --stageId <stage>` — get its absolute dir.
4. `Read` the file you actually want (`inbox.md` for human-readable, `messages.json` for raw, `error.txt` for a failure trace).

This avoids two anti-patterns: (a) attaching to the tmux pane just to read transcripts (interactive-only, breaks scripted flows), and (b) globbing `~/.atomic/sessions/` blind.

### Tracking multiple workflows

`atomic workflow status` (no id) returns every workflow on the atomic socket:

```bash
atomic workflow status
# {"workflows":[{"id":"…","overall":"in_progress",...},
#               {"id":"…","overall":"needs_review",...}]}
```

Useful when the user has several runs going. Sort by `overall` priority —
surface every `needs_review` / `awaiting_input` first, then `error`, then
`in_progress`. `completed` workflows can be reported in summary.

## Monitoring a running workflow

All three invocation paths (Path A, B, C) spawn sessions on the same `atomic`
tmux socket. Two surfaces expose monitoring commands:

1. **The global `atomic` binary (recommended for all paths).** Session
   management lives under `atomic session …` and `atomic workflow status`.
   Use `atomic workflow session connect` (not `atomic session connect`) when
   attaching to workflow-spawned sessions — it is the canonical surface and
   the form you should always quote back to the user:
   ```bash
   atomic session list
   atomic workflow status <session-id>
   atomic workflow session connect <session-id>      # new terminal recommended — takes over stdin/stdout
   atomic session kill <session-id> -y
   ```
2. **No-global-install fallback — `bunx atomic`.** The `atomic` CLI ships as a
   separate package (`@bastani/atomic`) from the SDK (`@bastani/atomic-sdk`).
   Add it alongside the SDK with `bun add @bastani/atomic` and the binary
   becomes available at `node_modules/.bin/atomic` so `bunx atomic …` works
   without a global install. Skip this if the user already has the global
   binary on `PATH`.

`runWorkflow` does **not** auto-register `session` or `status` subcommands on
user-app worker files. If the dev wants those commands inside their own CLI,
they wire them explicitly using the SDK session primitives:

```ts
import {
  listSessions,
  stopSession,
  attachSession,
  getSessionStatus,
} from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";
```

Because every workflow lands on the same atomic tmux socket regardless of
which path spawned it, the `atomic` CLI commands work for Path A and B
workflows just as well as for atomic builtins.

Detached workflows return immediately with a session name; the actual work
runs in the background. Use `status` to check whether the workflow is still
running, has completed, errored out, or paused for human input — without
attaching to its TUI.

```bash
# Via the global `atomic` CLI:
atomic workflow status atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4

# Via bunx atomic (SDK-only, no global install):
bunx atomic workflow status atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4

# Output:
# {"id":"atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4","overall":"in_progress","alive":true,
#  "sessions":[{"name":"orchestrator","status":"running",...}],...}
```

Five overall states the agent must handle distinctly:

| Status | Meaning | What you should do |
|---|---|---|
| `in_progress` | The orchestrator is running and no stage is paused | Wait, or report progress to the user |
| `awaiting_input` | A stage is mid-`AskUserQuestion` (or equivalent HIL primitive) and the SDK has emitted the elicitation event — but no transcript-level review marker is set yet. Surfaces in the orchestrator panel as a blue HIL pulse | **Surface this to the user immediately** — same UX as `needs_review`. The session is blocked waiting on a typed answer; nothing else will happen until the user attaches and responds |
| `needs_review` | At least one stage is paused for human input (HIL) — Copilot `ask_user`, OpenCode `question.asked`, Copilot/MCP elicitation, or a transcript-marker handoff that survives across reattach | **Surface this to the user immediately** — they need to attach with `atomic workflow session connect <id>` to respond, otherwise the workflow stalls indefinitely |
| `completed` | Workflow finished successfully | Report success and summarize the output |
| `error` | Fatal error or a stage failed | Report the `fatalError` field and offer to investigate logs |

`awaiting_input` and `needs_review` both outrank `completed` so a HIL pause
near the end is never reported as done while still waiting on a human.
A dead orchestrator with a stale snapshot is automatically downgraded to
`error`. The two HIL states differ in provenance: `awaiting_input` is a
live-event pulse (only visible while the elicitation tool is mid-call —
guarded transitions only allow `running → awaiting_input → running` per
`PanelStore`), while `needs_review` is durable (set when a stage's transcript
contains a review marker and survives across detach/reattach). Workflows that
use `AskUserQuestion` may surface either or both.

Omit the id to list every running workflow at once: `atomic workflow status`.
Useful when checking on multiple parallel runs, or when the user just asks
"what's running?".

## Cleaning up sessions

When the user is done with a workflow — or you launched one detached and it's
no longer needed — tear it down with `-y` so no confirmation prompt blocks you:

```bash
# Via the global atomic binary (works for all three paths — same tmux socket):
atomic session kill atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4 -y

# Via bunx atomic (SDK-only, no global install):
bunx atomic session kill atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4 -y
```

The `-y` flag is mandatory for agent use. Without it, the CLI calls
`@clack/prompts confirm`, which expects a TTY and will hang indefinitely in a
non-interactive context. Same flag works for `atomic workflow session kill`
and `atomic chat session kill`. Without an id, `kill -y` tears down every
in-scope session — only do that when the user has asked to stop everything.

## Worked examples

**Example A — atomic builtin, structured inputs**

> **User:** "run gen-spec on research/docs/2026-04-11-auth.md"

*(Note: `gen-spec` is a hypothetical builtin used here for pedagogical purposes. Real atomic builtins are `ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`, and `open-claude-design`.)*

1. Path C (atomic builtin). Run `atomic workflow list`. Output includes `gen-spec`. Good.
2. Target resolved exactly: `gen-spec`.
3. Run `atomic workflow inputs gen-spec -a claude`. Parse the JSON:
   `research_doc` (required string — already given), `focus` (required enum
   of `minimal|standard|exhaustive`, default `standard`), `notes`
   (optional text).
4. Ask via AskUserQuestion once: "What focus level for the spec?" with
   choices `minimal`, `standard`, `exhaustive`. User picks `standard`. Skip
   `notes` since it's optional.
5. Run: `atomic workflow -n gen-spec -a claude --research_doc=research/docs/2026-04-11-auth.md --focus=standard`
6. The CLI prints a session name like `atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4`.
   Tell the user, using the §"After starting" template:
   "Started workflow `gen-spec` (session id: `atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4`).
   To watch it run interactively, **open a new terminal** and run:
   `atomic workflow session connect atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4`.
   Status: `atomic workflow status atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4`.
   Stop: `atomic session kill atomic-wf-claude-gen-spec-a1b2c3d4 -y`."

**Example B — user app, free-form prompt**

> **User:** "run the summarize-pr workflow on 'add OAuth to the API'"

1. Path A. `src/claude-worker.ts` exists and calls `runWorkflow(summarizePrClaude)`.
   (If instead the user had a `src/cli.ts` with `createRegistry()` + `listWorkflows`,
   run `bun run src/cli.ts --help` to see the registered subcommands and confirm `summarize-pr`.)
2. Target resolved exactly: `summarize-pr`, agent `claude`.
3. Prompt already given in user's message. No AskUserQuestion needed. Check
   `defineWorkflow` source to confirm `prompt` is a declared input.
4. Run: `bun run src/claude-worker.ts --prompt="add OAuth to the API"`.
   (If the worker was built with a `[prompt...]` Commander argument, the positional
   form `bun run src/claude-worker.ts "add OAuth to the API"` works too.)
   The runtime prints a session name like `atomic-wf-claude-summarize-pr-a1b2c3d4`.
   For a detached run, the worker must wire `detach: true` to `runWorkflow` or
   expose its own `--detach` Commander option — there is no built-in `-d` on
   user-app workers.
5. Apply the §"After starting" rule. Tell the user:
   "Started workflow `summarize-pr` (session id: `atomic-wf-claude-summarize-pr-a1b2c3d4`).
   To watch it run interactively, **open a new terminal** and run:
   `atomic workflow session connect atomic-wf-claude-summarize-pr-a1b2c3d4`.
   Status: `atomic workflow status atomic-wf-claude-summarize-pr-a1b2c3d4`.
   Stop: `atomic session kill atomic-wf-claude-summarize-pr-a1b2c3d4 -y`."
6. `bunx atomic …` is equivalent if the global binary is not installed. Both
   talk to the same atomic tmux socket regardless of which path spawned the
   workflow.

**Example B1b — repo-shipped example, structured inputs**

> **User:** "run the hello-world example with a formal greeting"

1. Not a builtin name. Check `examples/hello-world/claude-worker.ts` — it exists.
   Path B.
2. Target resolved: `hello-world`, via `examples/hello-world/claude-worker.ts`.
3. Read `examples/hello-world/claude/index.ts` for the input schema:
   `greeting` (string, required), `style` (enum: formal/casual/robotic,
   default casual), `notes` (text, optional).
4. Ask via AskUserQuestion: "What should the greeting text be?" User
   supplies `"Hello there"`. `style=formal` is implied by the message.
5. Run: `bun run examples/hello-world/claude-worker.ts --greeting="Hello there" --style=formal`
6. Apply the §"After starting" rule. Tell the user:
   "Started workflow `hello-world` (session id: `<sessionId from CLI>`).
   To watch it run interactively, **open a new terminal** and run:
   `atomic workflow session connect <sessionId>`."

**Example B2 — atomic builtin, free-form prompt**

> **User:** "run ralph on 'add OAuth to the API'"

1. Path C (atomic builtin — `ralph` is shipped inside `@bastani/atomic-sdk`).
   Run `atomic workflow list`. Confirms `ralph` is registered.
2. Target resolved exactly: `ralph`, agent `claude`.
3. Prompt already given in user's message. No AskUserQuestion needed.
4. Run: `atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude "add OAuth to the API"`.
5. Apply the §"After starting" rule. Tell the user:
   "Started workflow `ralph` (session id: `<sessionId from CLI>`).
   To watch it run interactively, **open a new terminal** and run:
   `atomic workflow session connect <sessionId>`."

**Example C — workflow does not exist**

> **User:** "run the security-audit workflow on src/auth"

1. This sounds like a user app workflow. Run `bun run src/cli.ts --help` to
   list available subcommands. Output shows: `summarize-pr`, `triage-pr`. No `security-audit`.
2. Tell the user: "I don't see a `security-audit` workflow registered. Available: summarize-pr, triage-pr."
3. Ask via AskUserQuestion: "Want me to create a `security-audit` workflow
   first?" with choices `Yes, create it`, `No, use one of the existing
   workflows`, `No, cancel`.
4. If **Yes**: switch to SKILL.md's Authoring Process — interview the user
   for what the workflow should do, write the definition, register it in the
   composition root, typecheck, *then* return here and invoke.
5. If **No, use existing**: ask which one via AskUserQuestion, then continue.
6. If **Cancel**: stop, no command runs.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Not identifying the invocation path** — using `atomic workflow` for a
  user app, or `bun run src/worker.ts` for a builtin or a repo-shipped
  example, leads to "not found". Check the three paths in order (builtin
  → examples/ → user app) first.
- **Skipping the list command** — leads to guessing and `workflow not found`
  errors. Always list first.
- **Using `-n`/`-a`/`-d` on user-app workers** — these flags only exist on
  the `atomic` binary for builtins. User-app workers expose per-input `--<flag>`
  options and (optionally) a positional `[prompt...]` argument. There is no
  `-n`, `-a`, or `-d` built into user-app workers.
- **Inventing a workflow name** — if it's not in the list, it doesn't exist.
  Say so and offer to author it.
- **For builtins: reading the source to discover inputs** — use
  `atomic workflow inputs <name> -a <agent>` instead. JSON, always in sync.
- **Asking everything at once** — let AskUserQuestion drive one question per
  field. Enum fields are multiple-choice, not free text.
- **Re-asking what the user already said** — read their message first.
- **Forgetting to report the session name** — the user needs it to reattach
  and to query status later.
- **Reporting the session name without the new-terminal attach instruction** —
  every successful spawn must tell the user, in the *same message*, to
  **open a new terminal** and run `atomic workflow session connect <sessionId>`.
  See §"After starting: tell the user how to view it interactively" for the
  exact phrasing template. Omitting it leaves the user with a session id and
  no idea how to watch the workflow run.
- **Telling the user to attach in their current terminal** —
  `atomic workflow session connect` takes over stdin/stdout, so attaching in
  the chat shell kicks the user out of the chat. Always say "open a new
  terminal."
- **Substituting `atomic session connect` for `atomic workflow session connect`** —
  both reach the same socket, but the `workflow` form is the canonical surface
  for workflow-spawned sessions. Use it consistently.
- **Leaving `needs_review` unreported** — when `atomic workflow status`
  returns `needs_review`, surface it to the user right away. The workflow is
  blocked on human input and will sit forever otherwise.
- **Calling `session kill` without `-y`** — the prompt hangs in a
  non-interactive context. Always pass `-y` from an agent.
