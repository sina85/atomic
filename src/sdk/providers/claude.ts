 * Claude sessions, not when a user runs `claude` manually.
 *
 * Registered hooks:
 *   - `Stop`: deliver queued follow-up prompts via `{decision:"block"}` and
 *     write an idle-marker file that `waitForIdle` watches. `timeout` is
 *     set to {@link STOP_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS} so the hook survives long
 *     TaskCompleted/TeammateIdle phases — see the constant's docstring.
 *   - `PreToolUse` matched on `AskUserQuestion`: write
 *     `~/.atomic/claude-hil/<session_id>` so `watchHILMarker` can fire
 *     `onHIL(true)` — the node card flips to the blue "awaiting_input" pulse.
 *   - `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` matched on `AskUserQuestion`:
 *     remove the HIL marker. Claude Code fires exactly one of these per
 *     tool invocation (PostToolUse on success, PostToolUseFailure in the
 *     catch path — see `src/services/tools/toolExecution.ts` in the CLI
 *     source), so registering the same command on both guarantees the
 *     marker clears regardless of which completion path the tool takes.
 *   - `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop`: maintain a per-root-session marker
 *     dir under `~/.atomic/claude-inflight/<root>/` so the Stop hook and
 *     `clearClaudeSession` can both gate on subagent completion before
 *     letting the stage advance. Without this gate, a stage that spawned
 *     `run_in_background: true` subagents would tear down its pane while
 *     children still hold FDs/PTYs on the atomic tmux server, intermittently
 *     surfacing as `tmux respawn-pane: fork failed: Device not configured`
 *     when the next stage tried to spawn.
 *   - `TeammateIdle`: same gating applied at agent-team teammate idle.
 *     Unlike Stop, this fires when a teammate (potentially a different
 *     `session_id` from the stage's root) goes idle, so we route it to a
 *     focused `_claude-inflight-hook wait` mode that only awaits in-flight
 *     drain — no claude-stop marker write (that would confuse `waitForIdle`)
 *     and no queue/release polling (those are keyed on the stage's root).
 *
 * Built once at module load. Contains no single quotes (JSON syntax doesn't
 * produce them and paths rarely do), so POSIX single-quoting at the spawn
 * site is sufficient shell escaping.

 * 1. Attach the directory watcher, then check for the marker file on disk —
 *    this closes the race where the Stop hook fires between prompt submission
 *    and watcher attach.
 * 2. On any event, re-check the marker file on disk (we intentionally do NOT
 *    filter by `event.filename`, because on Linux a write can deliver multiple
 *    events with varying filenames and editor tools may race us).
 * 3. Read the session transcript via `getSessionMessages` and slice messages
 *    from `transcriptBeforeCount`.
 * 4. Clean up the `fs.watch` watcher on any exit path via AbortController.

 *     empty pane. Claude's first action is a Read tool call, which

 *     keystrokes, no paste-buffer dance, no pane-state polling — the
 *     whole delivery rides Claude's own continuation API.
 *
 * Both paths converge on `waitForIdle`, which watches the Stop-hook marker
 * file for this session and returns the transcript slice for the turn.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { claudeQuery } from "@bastani/atomic/workflows";
