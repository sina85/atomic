/**
 * Claude Stop Hook command — internal handler for Claude Code's Stop hook.
 *
 * Claude invokes `atomic _claude-stop-hook` at the end of every turn,
 * piping a JSON payload via stdin. This handler has two jobs:
 *
 *   1. Write a per-session marker file that the workflow runtime watches via
 *      `fs.watch` to detect turn completion (replacing tmux-pane scraping).
 *
 *   2. Deliver follow-up prompts without tmux send-keys. After the marker is
 *      written, this process block-polls `~/.atomic/claude-queue/<session_id>`.
 *      If the workflow enqueues a prompt there, we read it, delete the queue
 *      entry, and emit `{"decision":"block","reason":<prompt>}` on stdout.
 *      Claude Code treats `reason` as the next user message and keeps the
 *      agent loop running on the same session — no TUI keystrokes required.
 *      If the workflow instead signals session end via
 *      `~/.atomic/claude-release/<session_id>`, we exit 0 and let Claude stop.
 *
 * Usage (configured in Claude's Stop hook):
 *   atomic _claude-stop-hook
 *
 * Payload (JSON via stdin):
 *   {
 *     "session_id": "abc123",
 *     "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript",
 *     "cwd": "/path/to/cwd",
 *     "stop_hook_active": false
 *   }

  // reach Claude.
  //
  // Our design doesn't need the generic loop guard: the hook only emits a

  // the event entirely and hang forever. A direct write on a tiny payload is

  // The workflow's `waitForIdle` has already been unblocked by the marker
  // write above and is now returning control to the user's stage callback.
  // One of three things happens next:
  //
  //   a. The callback calls `s.session.query(next)`, which writes the next
  //      prompt to `~/.atomic/claude-queue/<session_id>`. We read it, delete
  //      the queue entry, and emit `{"decision":"block","reason":<prompt>}`
  //      on stdout. Claude Code feeds `reason` back as the next user message
  //      and keeps the turn loop running — no tmux keystrokes involved.
  //
  //   b. The callback returns and the runtime writes a release marker at
  //      `~/.atomic/claude-release/<session_id>`. We exit 0 with no stdout
  //      payload and Claude stops as usual.
  //
  //   c. Neither happens within `waitTimeoutMs`. We exit 0 so Claude Code
  //      doesn't hang past its own per-hook timeout. The production default
  //      for `waitTimeoutMs` is aligned with the Claude-side hook timeout
  //      (~24 days), so this path is effectively unreachable in real runs —
  //      it only fires in tests that pass a short override.
