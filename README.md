**Turn coding agents into reliable engineering workflows.** Atomic is an open-source CLI and TypeScript SDK for Claude Code, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot CLI. Define the steps, guardrails, review gates, and execution environment your agent should follow, then run the workflow as TypeScript your whole team can review and reuse.

> Build the workflow once. Run it across agents, repos, and teams — with GitHub, Azure DevOps (ADO), or Sapling.

---

## Migration from 0.6.x

If you were importing from `@bastani/atomic` for SDK use (`defineWorkflow`,
`createRegistry`, `WorkflowPicker`), switch to `@bastani/atomic-sdk`:

    bun remove @bastani/atomic
    bun add    @bastani/atomic-sdk

Update imports: `from "@bastani/atomic/workflows"` →
`from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows"`. The CLI (`atomic` command) keeps the
same package name; nothing changes for global-install users.

---

## Why Atomic

Coding agents are great inside a single session. They can inspect code, use tools, make edits, and explain their work. The trouble starts when the task is ambiguous/complex, tied to specific outcomes/exit criteria, long-running, or tied to a large codebase: you end up reminding the agent of the process, moving output between sessions, checking whether it followed the right steps, and deciding when a human needs to review the work. Atomic turns that process into code. A workflow can branch, retry, run stages in parallel, isolate sessions, pass only the right transcript forward, pause for human approval, and run inside a devcontainer so the agent is not loose on your host machine.

- **Start with your own process.** Automate the repetitive parts of research, product feedback, debugging, review, migrations, or PR prep. One TypeScript file, versioned with the repo.
- **Scale to your team.** Encode review gates, quality checks, and approvals so every teammate runs the same workflow instead of manually steering an agent.
- **Keep the coding agent.** Atomic adds structure around Claude Code, OpenCode, and Copilot CLI without rebuilding their file editing, tool use, MCP setup, hooks, or context handling from scratch.
- **Use natural language to get started.** Ask the `workflow-creator` skill to turn a workflow description into `defineWorkflow()` code, or let an agent use the skill when a complex task needs a repeatable workflow.
- **Control the outer loop.** Instead of trusting a black-box harness to improvise process, Atomic makes the orchestration inspectable: the agent stil uses it's harness with its native tools and context management, but the workflow, gates, handoffs, and execution graph are TypeScript you can read, edit, and version. This allows you to enhance your existing coding agent's capabilities.

## Quick Start

Install, generate context, try Ralph, then write your own workflow — four steps, a few minutes. Steps 1–3 are the **CLI** path (pre-built autonomous behaviour). Step 4 is the **SDK** path (your own workflows). Skip straight to step 4 if you only want the library.

### Prerequisites

Atomic doesn't replace your coding agent or terminal — it gives them a workflow to follow. Three things have to exist on the host before a workflow can run:

- **A terminal multiplexer** — every stage runs inside a detachable session on a dedicated `atomic` socket (your personal tmux is untouched). That's how workflows survive terminal disconnects, how `-d/--detach` puts a run in the background, and how `atomic session connect` reattaches later from any shell.
  - **macOS / Linux:** [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) — auto-installed on first `atomic` run via `brew` (macOS) or `apt`/`dnf`/`yum`/`pacman`/`zypper`/`apk` (Linux) when one is on `PATH`
  - **Windows:** [psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux) — auto-installed on first `atomic` run via `winget` / `scoop` / `choco` / `cargo`; detected as `psmux` / `pmux` / `tmux` on `PATH`
- **At least one coding agent** installed and logged in — Atomic spawns the agent's own CLI at each stage and talks to it via its SDK, so the CLI has to be present and authenticated:
  - [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart) — run `claude` and authenticate
  - [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — run `opencode` and authenticate
  - [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) — run `copilot` and authenticate

> The bootstrap installer below ships a prebuilt binary — it does **not** require Bun, Node, or any other runtime on your machine. tmux/psmux are not bundled but are **auto-installed lazily on the first non-info `atomic` command** (e.g. `atomic workflow list`) — atomic shells out to your platform's package manager (`brew`/`apt`/`dnf`/`yum`/`pacman`/`zypper`/`apk` on Unix, `winget`/`scoop`/`choco`/`cargo` on Windows), or you can pre-install yourself if you'd rather skip that step. Coding agents are **not** auto-installed — install and authenticate those separately. Using a [devcontainer](#alternative-devcontainer-recommended-for-autonomous-workflows) short-circuits all of this: the atomic feature bundles tmux + the agent CLI into the container image.

### 1. Install

`@bastani/atomic` is the CLI; `@bastani/atomic-sdk` is the library. Pick the one(s) you need.

**CLI path** — bootstrap script downloads a verified prebuilt binary, installs it to `~/.local/bin` (or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\atomic\bin` on Windows), updates your PATH, and sets up shell completions. No Bun/Node prerequisite.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flora131/atomic/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell 5.1+ or 7+)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flora131/atomic/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Windows (cmd.exe — for environments without PowerShell)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flora131/atomic/main/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

Pin a specific version by passing it as an argument: `bash install.sh 0.4.47`, `./install.ps1 0.4.47`, or `install.cmd 0.4.47`.

Upgrade later by re-running the same one-liner.

**SDK-only path** — if you only want to `defineWorkflow(...)` in your own TypeScript project and never need the `atomic` binary, skip the bootstrap and just add the library:

```bash
bun init -y                                      # new project
bun add @bastani/atomic-sdk                      # the SDK
bun add @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk           # the provider SDK you target
```

Skip steps 2–3 below (those use the CLI) and jump straight to [step 4](#4-build-your-own-workflow--sdk). If you only want the SDK, `bun add @bastani/atomic-sdk` — the CLI binary is not required. You'll still need tmux/psmux + an authenticated agent CLI at runtime — see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: Already have Bun? Install the CLI directly from npm</b></summary>

```bash
bun install -g @bastani/atomic
```

This skips the Bun install step but doesn't set up shell completions — run `atomic completions <shell>` separately if you want them (see [Commands Reference](#atomic-completions--shell-completions)).
If your shell cannot find `atomic` after the install, add the directory from `bun pm bin -g` to your PATH or use the bootstrap installer above to do it automatically.

**Prerelease builds:** `bun install -g @bastani/atomic@next` (may contain breaking changes).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Authenticated downloads (CI / enterprise)</b></summary>

The bootstrap downloads from `github.com/flora131/atomic/releases` (no API calls), so no token is required for normal use. If your environment proxies or rate-limits unauthenticated `github.com` traffic, route the download through your proxy or use `bun install -g @bastani/atomic` instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: Devcontainer (recommended for autonomous workflows)</b></summary>

> Devcontainers isolate the agent from your host, limiting the blast radius of destructive actions. This is the safest way to run workflows.

Add one feature to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

| Feature                              | Agent                |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/claude:1`   | Atomic + Claude Code |
| `ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/opencode:1` | Atomic + OpenCode    |
| `ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/copilot:1`  | Atomic + Copilot CLI |

Full `.devcontainer.json` templates per agent live in [`.devcontainer/`](./.devcontainer/). Each feature installs Atomic, bun, playwright-cli, agent configs, and the agent CLI itself. First run takes ~1 minute to warm up.

Minimal example (Claude + Rust):

```jsonc
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:latest",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils": {},
    "ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/claude:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {}
  },
  "remoteEnv": {
    "GH_TOKEN": "${localEnv:GH_TOKEN}",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "${localEnv:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

Use the [Dev Containers VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or the [Dev Container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli#dev-container-cli) to start the container.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Migrating from the old standalone binary?</b></summary>

Atomic used to ship as a standalone binary. It's now an npm package. One-time migration:

```bash
atomic uninstall
bun uninstall -g @bastani/atomic-workflows
rm -rf ~/.atomic ~/.copilot/skills ~/.opencode/skills
bun install -g @bastani/atomic
```

</details>

### 2. Generate context files — CLI

```bash
atomic chat -a <claude|opencode|copilot>
```

Then type `/init`. Atomic explores your codebase with sub-agents and writes `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` so every future session starts with the right context.

### 3. Try Ralph — CLI (autonomous coding)

Ralph plans, implements, reviews, and debugs a task on its own — up to 10 iterations, exiting after 2 consecutive clean reviews.

```bash
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude "Build a REST API for user management"
```

> ⚠️ Workflows run with agent permission checks **disabled** so pipelines don't block on prompts. Run them in a [devcontainer](#containerized-execution) or [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree), not on your host. See [Security](#security-workflow-permissions-model).

### 4. Build your own workflow — SDK

Every team has a process — code review, CI checks, PR creation, approval, merge. Encode it as TypeScript once; everyone runs the same pipeline.

```bash
bun init && bun add @bastani/atomic-sdk
```

Author the workflow in `src/workflows/review-to-merge/claude.ts`:

```ts
import { defineWorkflow } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";

export default defineWorkflow({
  name: "review-to-merge",
  description: "Review → CI → PR → Notify → Approve → Merge",
}).for("claude")
  .run(async (ctx) => {
    // 1. Review
    const review = await ctx.stage({ name: "review" }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
      await s.session.query("Review uncommitted changes for correctness, security, style.");
      s.save(s.sessionId);
    });

    // 2. Run security + CI in parallel
    await Promise.all([
      ctx.stage({ name: "security-scan" }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
        await s.session.query("Run `bun audit` and scan for leaked secrets.");
        s.save(s.sessionId);
      }),
      ctx.stage({ name: "ci-checks" }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
        await s.session.query("Run `bun lint` and `bun test`. Report failures.");
        s.save(s.sessionId);
      }),
    ]);

    // 3. Open PR, then notify Slack + wait for human approval
    await ctx.stage({ name: "notify-and-merge" }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
      const t = await s.transcript(review);
      await s.session.query(`Read ${t.path}. Open a PR summarizing the changes.`);

      await fetch("https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.SLACK_TOKEN}` },
        body: JSON.stringify({ channel: "#code-review", text: "PR ready — please approve." }),
      });

      // Human-in-the-loop: pauses until the user responds
      await s.session.query(
        "Ask the user to confirm approval, then merge with `gh pr merge --squash`.",
        { allowedTools: ["Bash", "Read", "AskUserQuestion"] },
      );
      s.save(s.sessionId);
    });
  })
  .compile();
```

Wire it to a CLI in `src/claude-worker.ts`. The SDK ships pure
primitives — no wrapper to opt into. Compose with your CLI library of
choice (Commander, citty, yargs, …) and call `runWorkflow`. Catch the
SDK's typed errors (`MissingDependencyError`, `SessionNotFoundError`,
…) for friendly CLI output:

```ts
import { Command } from "@commander-js/extra-typings";
import {
  getInputSchema,
  runWorkflow,
  MissingDependencyError,
} from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";
import workflow from "./workflows/review-to-merge/claude.ts";

const program = new Command();
for (const input of getInputSchema(workflow)) {
  program.option(`--${input.name} <value>`, input.description ?? "");
}
program.action(async (rawOpts) => {
  try {
    await runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs: rawOpts as Record<string, string> });
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof MissingDependencyError) {
      console.error(`Missing dependency: ${err.dependency}. Install it and retry.`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    throw err;
  }
});
await program.parseAsync();
```

Run it:

```bash
bun run src/claude-worker.ts --target_branch=main
```

That's the full shape — one workflow file, one composition root. The
SDK exposes primitives (`runWorkflow`, `getInputSchema`, `listWorkflows`,
`getName`, `getAgent`, `validateInputs`, `listSessions`, …) and the
developer composes them into whatever CLI shape they prefer. See
[Workflow SDK](#workflow-sdk--build-reliable-engineering-workflows) for
parallel stages, input schemas, headless stages, and the full API
reference.

### Managing sessions

Every chat and workflow runs inside an isolated [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) session on a dedicated socket (your personal tmux is untouched). If your terminal disconnects, your session keeps running — reconnect anytime.

```bash
atomic session list              # all sessions
atomic session connect           # interactive fuzzy picker
atomic session connect <name>    # by name
atomic session kill              # interactive multi-select
atomic session kill <name>       # kill one session by name
atomic session kill --all        # select all matching sessions, then confirm
atomic session kill --all --yes  # kill all matching sessions without prompts
```

Session names follow `atomic-chat-<id>` or `atomic-wf-<workflow>-<id>`. Scope with `atomic chat session …` or `atomic workflow session …`.

Need a workflow to run in the background while you do something else? Pass `-d` / `--detach`:

```bash
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude -d "build the auth module"   # returns immediately
atomic workflow session connect atomic-wf-claude-ralph-<id>      # attach later
```

Detached mode is what you want for scripted / CI automation and long-running tasks — the workflow keeps running on the atomic tmux socket regardless of your terminal.

## Two surfaces: CLI and SDK

Atomic ships **two** things that share one workflow runtime. You can use either on its own or both together:

Both surfaces call the same runtime underneath (tmux/psmux session graph, provider SDKs, detach/reattach) — they're two entry points, not two products. Neither depends on the other: you can `bun add @bastani/atomic-sdk` in a project without ever installing the global binary, and you can use `atomic chat` and the built-in workflows without writing any TypeScript.

## Example use cases

These are workflows you'd author with `defineWorkflow` and run from your own `src/<agent>-worker.ts` — see [step 4 of Quick Start](#4-build-your-own-workflow--sdk) for the three-line entrypoint. Atomic ships three built-in workflows (`ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`, `open-claude-design`); everything else is yours to define.

- **Review-to-merge pipeline.** Review code, run CI in parallel, open a PR, notify Slack, wait for approval, merge.
- **Support ticket to draft PR.** Reproduce the issue, find the root cause, try a fix in a sandbox, run tests, pause for review.
- **Production alert investigation.** Pull the failing trace, inspect recent commits, rank likely causes, then draft a fix or page the on-call with evidence.
- **Parallel UX testing.** Run many persona-specific agents against the same feature, aggregate structured feedback, and turn selected issues into tasks.
- **Large migration or refactor.** Research the codebase, split the work into safe batches, run implementation and review passes, and keep artifacts for later runs.

## Security: Workflow Permissions Model

> [!CAUTION]
> **Atomic workflows run coding agents with all permission checks disabled.** The agent can read, write, and delete files, execute arbitrary shell commands, and make network requests without prompting. This is required for unattended pipelines. **Run workflows in a [devcontainer](#containerized-execution), not on your host machine.**

| Agent                  | How permissions are bypassed                                         | Key flags / settings                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Code**        | CLI flag disables the interactive permission prompt entirely         | `--dangerously-skip-permissions`                                      |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | CLI flag enables auto-execution; SDK auto-approves all tool requests | `--yolo`, `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL=true`, `onPermissionRequest: approveAll` |
| **OpenCode**           | Permissions handled programmatically through the event stream        | Permission requests auto-replied via SSE events                       |

Defaults live in `src/services/config/definitions.ts` and `src/sdk/runtime/executor.ts`. Override per-project via `ProviderOverrides` in `.atomic/settings.json` — `chatFlags` replaces defaults entirely; `envVars` are merged.

## Core Features

### Multi-Agent Support

Atomic works across **three production coding agents** — switch with a flag and your workflows, skills, and sub-agents carry over.

| Agent              | Command                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Claude Code        | `atomic chat -a claude`   |
| OpenCode           | `atomic chat -a opencode` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `atomic chat -a copilot`  |

Each agent gets its own configuration directory (`.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.github/`), skills, and context files — all managed by Atomic.

### Workflow SDK — Build Reliable Engineering Workflows

The Workflow SDK (`@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows`) lets you encode your team's process as TypeScript — spawn agent sessions dynamically with native control flow (`for`, `if`, `Promise.all()`), pass state explicitly, and watch each stage appear in a live graph as it runs.

Set up a workflow project (`bun init && bun add @bastani/atomic-sdk`), define your workflow with `defineWorkflow`, then call `runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })` from inside whatever CLI library you prefer (Commander, citty, yargs, an OpenTUI app, …). The SDK ships pure primitives — no opinionated wrapper:

```bash
bun run src/claude-worker.ts --prompt="describe this project"
```

See [step 4 of Quick Start](#4-build-your-own-workflow--sdk) for a complete review-to-merge example. More examples and the full API reference below.

#### Runnable examples shipped with the repo

The [`examples/`](./examples) directory contains small, complete user apps you can run directly. Most subdirectories ship `claude/`, `copilot/`, and `opencode/` variants plus one agent-scoped worker file per agent — `claude-worker.ts`, `copilot-worker.ts`, `opencode-worker.ts` — each a small Commander entrypoint that calls `runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })`. `multi-workflow/` and `commander-embed/` use a single `cli.ts` instead, to demonstrate multi-workflow dispatch and Commander embedding respectively.

**Design principle — when does `-a/--agent` belong on your CLI?** Each agent-scoped worker file imports a single workflow pinned to one agent (`import workflow from "./claude/index.ts"`), so there's nothing to disambiguate — no `-a` flag. Only reach for `-a/--agent` when one CLI dispatches across workflows that exist in multiple agent variants — e.g. a `cli.ts` that registers `hello` for claude *and* copilot. The atomic CLI itself uses `-a` for exactly that reason: its builtin registry has cross-agent variants of `ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`, and `open-claude-design`.

| `commander-embed`               | Mount an atomic workflow under a parent Commander CLI by calling `runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })` inside a Commander action, alongside a plain Commander sibling command.

| `pane-navigation`               | Driver CLI for the SDK pane-navigation primitives (`nextWindow`, `previousWindow`, `gotoOrchestrator`, `attachSession`, `detachSession`). Spawns a 3-stage workflow detached and exposes `start / list / status / next / prev / home / attach / stop` subcommands. Catches `SessionNotFoundError` for friendly errors. |

Run any of them with:

```bash
# Single-workflow workers — agent is pinned by which file you run, so no `-a` flag.
# Inputs map to `--<input>=<value>` flags; if the workflow declares no inputs,
# trailing positional tokens become the prompt.

bun run examples/review-fix-loop/claude-worker.ts --topic="adopting Bun" --max_iterations=3
bun run examples/headless-test/copilot-worker.ts --prompt="TypeScript"

# Multi-workflow CLI — one cli.ts, one Commander subcommand per registered workflow.
bun run examples/multi-workflow/cli.ts hello   --who=Alex
bun run examples/multi-workflow/cli.ts goodbye --tone=melodramatic

# Commander embedding — atomic workflow mounted as `greet` alongside plain Commander commands.

bun run examples/commander-embed/cli.ts --help                # all commands
```

Copy an example directory into your project as a starting point — swap the workflow import in each `<agent>-worker.ts` (or in `cli.ts` for the multi-workflow / commander-embed shapes) for your own definition and you're done.

<summary><b>Example: Structured-input workflow (declared schema + CLI flag validation)</b></summary>

Declare `inputs` on `defineWorkflow` and the CLI materialises one `--<field>=<value>` flag per entry. Required fields, enum membership, and unknown-flag rejection are validated before any tmux session spawns. The interactive picker renders the same schema as a form.

```ts
import { defineWorkflow } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";

export default defineWorkflow({
  name: "gen-spec",
  description: "Convert a research doc into an execution spec",
  inputs: [
    {
      name: "research_doc",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "path to the research doc",
      placeholder: "research/docs/2026-04-11-auth.md",
    },
    {
      name: "focus",
      type: "enum",
      required: true,
      description: "how aggressively to scope the spec",
      values: ["minimal", "standard", "exhaustive"],
      default: "standard",
    },
    {
      name: "notes",
      type: "text",
      description: "extra guidance for the spec writer (optional)",
    },
  ],
}).for("claude")
  .run(async (ctx) => {
    const { research_doc, focus } = ctx.inputs;
    const notes = ctx.inputs.notes ?? "";

    await ctx.stage({ name: "write-spec" }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
      await s.session.query(
        `Read ${research_doc} and produce a ${focus} spec.` +
          (notes ? `\n\nExtra guidance:\n${notes}` : ""),
      );
      s.save(s.sessionId);
    });
  })
  .compile();
```

Wire it into `src/claude-worker.ts` (three lines — see [step 4 of Quick Start](#4-build-your-own-workflow--sdk)) and run it:

```bash
# Scriptable; CI-friendly
bun run src/claude-worker.ts \
  --research_doc=research/docs/2026-04-11-auth.md \
  --focus=standard

<summary><b>Example: Headless (background) stages for parallel data gathering</b></summary>

Stages can run headlessly (`headless: true`) — they execute the provider SDK in-process instead of spawning a tmux window. Headless stages are invisible in the graph but tracked via a background counter in the statusline.

```ts
import { defineWorkflow, extractAssistantText } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";

export default defineWorkflow({
  name: "headless-demo",
  description: "seed -> [3 headless background] -> merge",
  inputs: [{ name: "prompt", type: "text", required: true, description: "task prompt" }],
}).for("claude")
  .run(async (ctx) => {
    const prompt = ctx.inputs.prompt ?? "";

    const seed = await ctx.stage(
      { name: "seed", description: "Generate overview" }, {}, {},
      async (s) => {
        const result = await s.session.query(prompt);
        s.save(s.sessionId);
        return extractAssistantText(result, 0);
      },
    );

    const [pros, cons, uses] = await Promise.all([
      ctx.stage({ name: "pros", headless: true }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
        const r = await s.session.query(`List 3 pros:\n\n${seed.result}`);
        s.save(s.sessionId);
        return extractAssistantText(r, 0);
      }),
      ctx.stage({ name: "cons", headless: true }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
        const r = await s.session.query(`List 3 cons:\n\n${seed.result}`);
        s.save(s.sessionId);
        return extractAssistantText(r, 0);
      }),
      ctx.stage({ name: "uses", headless: true }, {}, {}, async (s) => {
        const r = await s.session.query(`List 3 use cases:\n\n${seed.result}`);
        s.save(s.sessionId);
        return extractAssistantText(r, 0);
      }),
    ]);

    await ctx.stage(
      { name: "merge", description: "Combine results" }, {}, {},
      async (s) => {
        await s.session.query(
          `Combine:\n\n## Pros\n${pros.result}\n\n## Cons\n${cons.result}\n\n## Uses\n${uses.result}`,
        );
        s.save(s.sessionId);
      },
    );
  })
  .compile();
```

The graph shows `seed → merge` — headless stages are transparent to the topology. The callback API (`s.client`, `s.session`, `s.save()`, `s.transcript()`, return values) is identical to interactive stages.

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability                         | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic session spawning**       | `ctx.stage()` spawns sessions at runtime — each gets its own tmux window and graph node                                            |
| **Native TypeScript control flow** | Use `for`, `if/else`, `Promise.all()`, `try/catch` — no framework DSL                                                              |
| **Review gates and approvals**     | Pause for human input, run structured review stages, and decide whether the next stage should continue                             |
| **Session return values**          | Session callbacks can return data: `const h = await ctx.stage(...); h.result`                                                      |
| **Transcript passing**             | Access prior output via handle (`s.transcript(handle)`) or name (`s.transcript("name")`)                                           |
| **Declared input schemas**         | Add an `inputs: [...]` array and the CLI materialises `--<field>=<value>` flags with built-in validation                           |
| **Interactive picker**             | `atomic workflow -a <agent>` is the explicit no-`-n` discovery path; direct runs use `-n <name>`                                   |
| **Nested sub-sessions**            | `s.stage()` inside a callback spawns child sessions — visible as nested graph nodes                                                |
| **Auto-inferred graph**            | Topology derived from `await` / `Promise.all` patterns — no annotations                                                            |
| **Provider-agnostic**              | Write raw SDK code for Claude, Copilot, or OpenCode inside each callback                                                           |
| **Live graph visualization**       | Sessions appear in the TUI graph as they spawn — loops and conditionals visible in real time                                       |
| **Background (headless) stages**   | `headless: true` runs in-process without a tmux window — invisible in graph, tracked by statusline counter, identical callback API |
| **Token-aware handoffs**           | Save transcripts to disk and pass paths or distilled outputs forward instead of stuffing every stage with the full history         |

**Deterministic execution guarantees:**

Workflows are deterministic by design — the same definition produces the same execution order with the same data flow, anywhere.

- **Strict step ordering** — Step 2 never starts until Step 1 finishes. Parallel sessions complete (or fail fast) before the next step begins.
- **Frozen definitions** — `.compile()` freezes the workflow. Once compiled, step order, session names, and the execution graph are immutable.
- **Controlled transcript access** — Sessions only read transcripts from *completed* upstream sessions; parallel siblings can't read each other.
- **Isolated context windows** — Each session runs in its own tmux pane with a fresh context. Data flows only through explicit `ctx.transcript()` / `ctx.getMessages()` calls.
- **Persisted artifacts** — Every session writes messages, transcript, and metadata to disk — a complete, inspectable execution record.

Variance comes from the LLM's responses, not from a changing workflow.

<summary><b>Full Workflow SDK Reference</b></summary>

#### Builder API

| Method                                  | Purpose                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defineWorkflow({ name, description })` | Entry point — returns a `WorkflowBuilder`                         |
| `.run(async (ctx) => { ... })`          | Set the workflow's entry point — `ctx` is a `WorkflowContext`     |
| `.compile()`                            | **Required** — terminal method that seals the workflow definition |

#### WorkflowContext (`ctx`) — top-level workflow context

| Property                                       | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `ctx.inputs`                                   | `{ [K in N]?: string }`     | Typed inputs for this run — only declared field names are valid keys. Accessing an undeclared field is a compile-time error. Workflows that need a prompt must declare it in their `inputs` schema |
| `ctx.agent`                                    | `AgentType`                 | Which agent is running (`"claude"`, `"copilot"`, `"opencode"`)                                                                                                                                     |
| `ctx.stage(opts, clientOpts, sessionOpts, fn)` | `Promise<SessionHandle<T>>` | Spawn a session — returns handle with `name`, `id`, `result`                                                                                                                                       |
| `ctx.transcript(ref)`                          | `Promise<Transcript>`       | Get a completed session's transcript (`{ path, content }`)                                                                                                                                         |
| `ctx.getMessages(ref)`                         | `Promise<SavedMessage[]>`   | Get a completed session's raw native messages                                                                                                                                                      |

#### SessionContext (`s`) — inside each session callback

| Property                                     | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `s.client`                                   | `ProviderClient<A>`         | Pre-created SDK client (auto-managed by runtime)                                                                                |

| `s.inputs`                                   | `{ [K in N]?: string }`     | Same typed inputs as `ctx.inputs`, forwarded into every stage so callbacks can read values without closing over the outer `ctx` |
| `s.agent`                                    | `AgentType`                 | Which agent is running                                                                                                          |
| `s.paneId`                                   | `string`                    | tmux pane ID for this session                                                                                                   |
| `s.sessionId`                                | `string`                    | Session UUID                                                                                                                    |
| `s.sessionDir`                               | `string`                    | Path to this session's storage directory on disk                                                                                |
| `s.save(messages)`                           | `SaveTranscript`            | Save this session's output for subsequent sessions                                                                              |
| `s.transcript(ref)`                          | `Promise<Transcript>`       | Get a completed session's transcript                                                                                            |

#### Session Options (`SessionRunOptions`)

| Property      | Type       | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | `string`   | Unique session name within the workflow run                                                           |
| `description` | `string?`  | Human-readable description shown in the graph                                                         |
| `headless`    | `boolean?` | When `true`, run in-process without a tmux window — invisible in graph, tracked by background counter |

The runtime auto-infers parent-child edges from execution order: sequential `await` creates a chain, `Promise.all` creates parallel fan-out/fan-in — no annotations needed.

#### Saving Transcripts

Each provider saves transcripts differently:

| Provider     | How to Save                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude**   | `s.save(s.sessionId)` — auto-reads via `getSessionMessages()`     |
| **Copilot**  | `s.save(await session.getMessages())` — pass `SessionEvent[]`     |
| **OpenCode** | `s.save(result.data!)` — pass the full `{ info, parts }` response |

#### Per-Agent Session APIs

The runtime auto-creates `s.client` and `s.session` — use them directly inside the callback:

| Agent        | How to send a prompt                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude**   | `await s.session.query(prompt)`                                                                       |
| **Copilot**  | `await s.session.send({ prompt })`                                                                    |
| **OpenCode** | `await s.client.session.prompt({ sessionID: s.session.id, parts: [{ type: "text", text: prompt }] })` |

#### Key Rules

1. Every workflow definition must call `.run()` and `.compile()` on the builder
2. Session names must be unique within a workflow run
3. `transcript()` / `getMessages()` only access completed sessions (callback returned + saves flushed)
4. Each session runs in its own tmux window with the chosen agent
5. Run a workflow by calling `runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })` from inside any CLI library (Commander, citty, yargs, …). Use `listWorkflows(registry)` to iterate when registering multiple workflows.
6. Set up your workflow project with `bun init && bun add @bastani/atomic-sdk`
7. Background (headless) stages use the same callback API — `s.client`, `s.session`, `s.save()`, return values all work identically

For the authoring walkthrough ask Atomic to use the `workflow-creator` skill or read `.agents/skills/workflow-creator/`.

> [!TIP]
> When the Workflow SDK is updated, ask the `workflow-creator` skill to migrate your workflows to the latest patterns: _"Update this workflow to use the latest SDK patterns."_

atomic chat -a claude "/research-codebase Research GraphRAG using LangChain's graph retrieval."

# Terminal 2: Microsoft GraphRAG
atomic chat -a claude "/research-codebase Research GraphRAG using microsoft/graphrag."

# Terminal 3: LlamaIndex approach
atomic chat -a claude "/research-codebase Research GraphRAG using LlamaIndex's property graph."
```

Then run `/create-spec` on each output, spin up git worktrees, and run `atomic workflow -n ralph -a <agent>` in each — wake up to three complete implementations on separate branches. Research persists in `research/` and specs in `specs/`, so every investigation compounds into future context.

<details>
<summary><i>Why specialized research agents instead of one general-purpose agent?</i></summary>

A single agent asked to "research the auth system" tries to search, read, analyze, and summarize within one context window. As that window fills with file contents, search results, and intermediate reasoning, synthesis degrades — this is a fundamental constraint of transformer attention, not a prompt-engineering problem.

Atomic dispatches purpose-built sub-agents: a `codebase-locator` only finds relevant files, a `codebase-analyzer` only reads and analyzes implementations, a `codebase-online-researcher` only queries external docs. Each operates in its own context with only the tools it needs; the parent receives distilled findings. The result: faster research, higher-quality findings, less hallucination.

### Autonomous Execution (Ralph)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ralph-wiggum.jpg" alt="Ralph Wiggum" width="600">
</p>

The [Ralph Method](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) enables **multi-hour autonomous coding sessions**. Approve your spec, let Ralph work in the background, focus on other things.

**How Ralph works:**

1. **Task Decomposition** — A `planner` sub-agent breaks your spec into a task list with dependency tracking, stored in SQLite (WAL mode for parallel access).
2. **Execution** — An `orchestrator` retrieves the task list, validates the dependency graph, and dispatches `worker` sub-agents for ready tasks.
3. **Review & Debug** — A `reviewer` audits the implementation with structured JSON output; if P0–P2 findings exist, a `debugger` investigates root causes and feeds back to the planner on the next iteration.

**Loop config:** Up to **10 iterations**. Exits early after **2 consecutive clean reviews** (zero actionable findings). P3 (minor) findings are non-actionable.

```bash
# From a prompt
atomic workflow -n ralph -a <claude|opencode|copilot> "Build a REST API for user management"

# From a spec file
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude "specs/YYYY-MM-DD-my-feature.md"
```

**Best practice:** run Ralph in a [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) so autonomous changes stay isolated from your working tree:

```bash
git worktree add ../my-project-ralph feature-branch
cd ../my-project-ralph
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude "Build the auth module"
```

### Deep Research Codebase

Atomic ships a `deep-research-codebase` workflow that performs **multi-agent parallel research** across your codebase — a full pipeline, not a single-shot command.

1. **Scout** — One agent scans the codebase structure and writes an architectural orientation.
2. **History** — A parallel agent surfaces prior research from `research/docs/`.
3. **Explorers** — Multiple parallel agents (count scaled by LOC) each investigate a partition.
4. **Aggregator** — A final agent synthesizes all explorer reports + history into a dated research doc at `research/docs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.

```bash
atomic workflow -n deep-research-codebase -a claude "How does the authentication system work?"
```

The output is a permanent research artifact that future runs, specs, and workflows can reference.

### Containerized Execution

Atomic ships as **devcontainer features** that bundle the CLI, agent, and all dependencies into isolated containers — the recommended way to run autonomous agents safely.

**Why containerize?**

- Agents run `rm`, `git reset --hard`, and arbitrary shell commands — containers limit blast radius
- Reproducible environments across team members and CI
- Pre-installed dependencies: bun, playwright-cli, agent CLI, GitHub CLI
- Features versioned in sync with Atomic releases

| Feature                              | Installs             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/claude:1`   | Atomic + Claude Code |
| `ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/opencode:1` | Atomic + OpenCode    |
| `ghcr.io/flora131/atomic/copilot:1`  | Atomic + Copilot CLI |

See [Quick Start → Devcontainer](#1-install) for a working `.devcontainer.json` and the [`.devcontainer/`](./.devcontainer/) directory for per-agent templates.

### Specialized Sub-Agents

Atomic dispatches **purpose-built sub-agents**, each with scoped context, tools, and termination conditions:

| Sub-Agent                    | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `planner`                    | Decompose specs into structured task lists with dependency tracking |
| `worker`                     | Implement single focused tasks (multiple workers run in parallel)   |
| `reviewer`                   | Audit implementations against specs and best practices              |
| `code-simplifier`            | Simplify and refine code for clarity, consistency, maintainability  |
| `orchestrator`               | Coordinate complex multi-step workflows                             |
| `codebase-analyzer`          | Analyze implementation details of specific components               |
| `codebase-locator`           | Locate files, directories, and components                           |
| `codebase-pattern-finder`    | Find similar implementations and usage examples                     |
| `codebase-online-researcher` | Research using web sources and DeepWiki                             |
| `codebase-research-analyzer` | Deep dive on research topics                                        |
| `codebase-research-locator`  | Find documents in `research/` directory                             |
| `debugger`                   | Debug errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior                |

<details>
<summary><i>Why specialize instead of using one general-purpose agent?</i></summary>

LLMs have an architectural limitation: the more context they hold, the harder it becomes to attend to the right information. A single agent juggling a spec, dozens of files, tool outputs, and its own reasoning will lose details, repeat work, or hallucinate connections. This isn't solvable via prompt engineering — it's how attention mechanisms work.

Specialized sub-agents turn the limitation into an advantage:

- **Context isolation** — Fresh, minimal context scoped to one job. A `codebase-locator` doesn't carry file contents; a `worker` doesn't carry the full spec.
- **Tool scoping** — Agents only see tools relevant to their role. A `reviewer` has read-only tools and can't edit files; a `worker` has edit tools but can't spawn other workers.
- **Parallel execution** — Independent sub-agents run concurrently. One worker writes the migration, another writes the handler, a third generates tests — all at once.
- **Composability** — Sub-agents combine into workflows or dispatch ad-hoc. The same `reviewer` used by Ralph is the one invoked when you ask for a code review in chat.

A specialized `codebase-analyzer` reading three files produces more accurate output than a generalist that has already consumed 50,000 tokens of search results and prior reasoning.

Use `/agents` in any chat session to see all available sub-agents.

> **Note on source control providers:** the GitHub and Azure DevOps MCP servers are **disabled by default** to avoid consuming tokens on projects that don't need them. Set `scm` in `.atomic/settings.json` (or run `atomic config set scm <provider>`) to `github`, `azure-devops`, or `sapling` — on every `atomic chat` / `atomic workflow` startup Atomic reconciles `.claude/settings.json` (`disabledMcpjsonServers`), `.opencode/opencode.json` (`mcp.<server>.enabled`), and appends `--disable-mcp-server <name>` to the Copilot CLI invocation (Copilot has no on-disk MCP toggle). `sapling` disables both servers everywhere.

### Workflow Panel

During `atomic workflow` execution, Atomic renders a live workflow panel built on [OpenTUI](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui) over the workflow's tmux session graph. It shows:

- **Session graph** — Nodes per `.stage()` with status (pending / running / completed / failed) and edges for sequential / parallel dependencies
- **Task list tracking** — Ralph's decomposed task list with dependency arrows, updated in real time
- **Pane previews** — Thumbnail of each tmux pane so you can see every agent without context-switching
- **Transcript passing visibility** — Highlights `s.save()` / `s.transcript()` handoffs as they happen

During `atomic chat`, there is no Atomic-owned TUI — `atomic chat -a <agent>` spawns the native agent CLI inside a tmux session, so chat features (streaming, `@` mentions, `/slash-commands`, model selection, theme, keyboard shortcuts) come from the agent CLI itself. Atomic handles config sync, tmux session management, and argument passthrough.

| Context                                | UI provider                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atomic workflow -n <name> -a <agent>` | Atomic (workflow panel + tmux session graph)                |
| `atomic chat -a <agent>`               | The native agent CLI (Claude Code / OpenCode / Copilot CLI) |

| `-v, --version` | Show version number                        |

#### `atomic session` Subcommands

Available at three levels — scoped or global:

| Command                                  | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atomic session list`                    | List all running sessions                               |
| `atomic session connect [name]`          | Attach to a session (interactive picker when no name)   |
| `atomic session kill [name]`             | Kill one session, or interactively pick sessions        |
| `atomic chat session list`               | List running chat sessions only                         |
| `atomic chat session connect [name]`     | Attach to a chat session                                |
| `atomic chat session kill [name]`        | Kill one chat session, or interactively pick chat sessions |
| `atomic workflow session list`           | List running workflow sessions only                     |
| `atomic workflow session connect [name]` | Attach to a workflow session                            |
| `atomic workflow session kill [name]`    | Kill one workflow session, or interactively pick workflow sessions |

`list`, `connect`, and `kill` accept `-a <agent>` (repeatable) to filter by agent. `kill` confirms before terminating sessions unless `-y` / `--yes` is passed. When no session name is given, `kill` opens a checkbox picker with an "All matching sessions" option; use `--all` to skip the picker and preselect every matching session.

```bash
atomic session list                      # all sessions
atomic session list -a claude            # only Claude sessions
atomic session connect my-session        # attach by name
atomic session connect                   # interactive picker
atomic chat session list -a copilot      # chat sessions for Copilot only
atomic session kill my-session           # kill one session by name
atomic session kill                      # choose sessions with a multi-select picker
atomic session kill --all                # kill all sessions after confirmation
atomic session kill --all --yes          # kill all sessions without prompts
atomic workflow session kill -a claude   # choose Claude workflow sessions to kill
atomic workflow session kill -a claude --all --yes
```

All other arguments are forwarded directly to the native agent CLI:

```bash
atomic chat -a claude "fix the bug"          # initial prompt
atomic chat -a copilot --model gpt-5.4       # custom model
atomic chat -a claude --verbose              # forward --verbose to claude

| `-n, --name <name>`  | Workflow name (required for direct runs; omit only for the interactive picker)                                                                    |
| `-a, --agent <name>` | Agent: `claude`, `opencode`, `copilot`                                                                                                            |
| `-d, --detach`       | Start the workflow in the background without attaching — ideal for scripted / CI runs; attach later with `atomic workflow session connect <name>` |
| `--<field>=<value>`  | Structured input for workflows that declare an `inputs` schema (also accepts `--<field> <value>`)                                                 |
| `[prompt...]`        | Positional prompt — requires the workflow to declare a `prompt` input                                                                             |

Five invocation shapes:

```bash
# 1. List every workflow available, grouped by source
atomic workflow list
atomic workflow list -a claude       # filter by agent

# 2. Launch the interactive picker (no -n) — fuzzy-search, fill the form, confirm with y/n
atomic workflow -a claude

# 3. Run with a positional prompt (workflow must declare a "prompt" input)
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude "build a REST API for user management"

# 4. Run a structured-input workflow with one --<field> flag per declared input
atomic workflow -n open-claude-design -a claude \
  --prompt="a dashboard for monitoring API latency" \
  --output-type=prototype

# 5. Run detached — workflow runs in the background; prints the session name
#    and returns immediately. Attach any time with `atomic workflow session connect`.
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude -d "build a REST API for user management"
```

Workflows that declare `inputs: WorkflowInput[]` get CLI flag validation for free. **Builtin workflows (e.g. `ralph`) are reserved** — a local/global workflow with the same name will not shadow a builtin.

#### `atomic completions` — Shell Completions

Atomic ships tab-completion for **bash**, **zsh**, **fish**, and **PowerShell**. Cache the script once so new shells don't re-spawn the atomic binary on startup.

<details>
<summary><b>Bash / Zsh / Fish / PowerShell setup</b></summary>

**Bash**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.atomic/completions
atomic completions bash > ~/.atomic/completions/atomic.bash
echo '[ -f "$HOME/.atomic/completions/atomic.bash" ] && source "$HOME/.atomic/completions/atomic.bash"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Zsh**

```zsh
mkdir -p ~/.atomic/completions
atomic completions zsh > ~/.atomic/completions/atomic.zsh
echo '[ -f "$HOME/.atomic/completions/atomic.zsh" ] && source "$HOME/.atomic/completions/atomic.zsh"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Fish**

```fish
atomic completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/atomic.fish
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
$cache = Join-Path $HOME '.atomic\completions\atomic.ps1'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path (Split-Path $cache) | Out-Null
atomic completions powershell | Out-File -FilePath $cache -Encoding utf8
Add-Content $PROFILE "`nif (Test-Path `"$cache`") { . `"$cache`" }"
```

</details>

> The bootstrap installer (`install.sh` / `install.ps1` / `install.cmd`) sets this up automatically and migrates older `eval "$(atomic completions …)"` snippets to the cached form.

### Atomic-Provided Skills (invokable from any agent chat)

Atomic ships skills — not slash commands. Skills are auto-discovered by Claude Code, OpenCode, and Copilot CLI, invoked by typing `/<skill-name>` (Claude Code) or by natural-language reference (OpenCode / Copilot CLI).

| Skill               | Typical invocation                | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`              | `/init`                           | Generate `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` by exploring the codebase                  |
| `research-codebase` | `/research-codebase "<question>"` | Dispatch parallel sub-agents to analyze the codebase and write a research doc   |
| `create-spec`       | `/create-spec "<research-path>"`  | Produce a technical spec grounded in a research document                        |
| `explain-code`      | `/explain-code "<path>"`          | Deep-dive explanation of specific code using DeepWiki                           |
| `gh-commit`         | `/gh-commit`                      | Create a conventional-commit Git commit                                         |
| `gh-create-pr`      | `/gh-create-pr`                   | Commit, push, and open a GitHub pull request                                    |
| `ado-commit`        | `/ado-commit`                     | Create a conventional-commit Git commit on an Azure DevOps-hosted repo          |
| `ado-create-pr`     | `/ado-create-pr`                  | Commit, push, and open an Azure DevOps PR through the `azure-devops` MCP server |
| `sl-commit`         | `/sl-commit`                      | Create a Sapling commit                                                         |
| `sl-submit-diff`    | `/sl-submit-diff`                 | Submit a Sapling commit as a Phabricator diff                                   |
| `workflow-creator`  | natural language                  | Generate a multi-agent workflow definition using `defineWorkflow` + registry    |

Native slash commands (`/help`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `/model`, `/theme`, `/agents`, `/mcp`, `/exit`) come from the underlying agent CLI, not Atomic.

## Building your own atomic-powered app

`@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows` is a library, not just a CLI. Use it directly to build your own TypeScript app that runs your team's workflows.

> **SDK-only users:** you don't need the global `atomic` binary, but you still need the runtime prerequisites — **[Bun](https://bun.sh/) (the SDK does not run on Node.js)**, a terminal multiplexer (tmux on macOS/Linux, psmux on Windows), and at least one authenticated coding agent CLI (`claude`, `opencode`, or `copilot`). See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for the "why" and install commands. The SDK spawns the agent CLI at each stage and wraps it in a detachable multiplexer session.
>
> **Session management primitives.** The SDK exposes `listSessions`, `getSession`, `stopSession`, `attachSession`, `detachSession`, `getSessionStatus`, `getSessionTranscript`, plus pane-navigation verbs `nextWindow` / `previousWindow` / `gotoOrchestrator` — wire them into your CLI's `session list`, `status`, etc. subcommands as you see fit. Sessions live on the shared `atomic` tmux socket, so a worker CLI built on the primitives, the global `atomic` binary, and `bunx atomic` all see the same runtime state.
>
> **Typed errors.** Every error path the SDK throws — missing tmux/psmux/bun, unknown session id, missing `.compile()`, invalid workflow file, `minSDKVersion` mismatch — is a typed class (`MissingDependencyError`, `SessionNotFoundError`, `WorkflowNotCompiledError`, `InvalidWorkflowError`, `IncompatibleSDKError`). Catch them with `instanceof` to render friendly CLI output without parsing message text. See `examples/pane-navigation/cli.ts` for a worked example.

### Primitives, not a wrapper

The SDK ships pure functions you compose into whatever CLI shape you want:

| Primitive                                                                                                                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Pass `source: import.meta.path`.                                                                                                                           |
| `createRegistry`                                                                                                         | Build an immutable registry of workflows for iteration / lookup.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `listWorkflows(reg)`                                                                                                     | Snapshot every workflow in a registry.                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `validateInputs(wf, raw)`                                                                                                | Run the same validation pipeline atomic uses (required, defaults, enum, integer).                                                                                                                                   |
| `runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs, detach? })`                                                                             | Spawn the orchestrator tmux session and (optionally) attach.

| `listSessions / getSession / stopSession / attachSession / detachSession`                                                | Manage running tmux sessions on the shared atomic socket.                                                                                                                                                           |

Never auto-attach; an attached client sees the change live, otherwise a subsequent `attachSession` lands on the new window. |
| `MissingDependencyError / SessionNotFoundError / WorkflowNotCompiledError / InvalidWorkflowError / IncompatibleSDKError` | **Typed errors** thrown by the primitives above. Catch with `instanceof` to render friendly CLI messages without parsing message text.                                                                              |

**Single workflow (most common):**

```ts
// src/claude-worker.ts
import { Command } from "@commander-js/extra-typings";
import { getInputSchema, runWorkflow } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";
import workflow from "./workflows/review-to-merge/claude.ts";

const program = new Command();
for (const input of getInputSchema(workflow)) {
  program.option(`--${input.name} <value>`, input.description ?? "");
}
program.action(async (rawOpts) => {
  const inputs = rawOpts as Record<string, string>;
  await runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs });
});
await program.parseAsync();
```

Run it:

```bash
bun run src/claude-worker.ts --target_branch=release/v2
```

**Multiple workflows — iterate a registry:**

```ts
// src/cli.ts
import { Command } from "@commander-js/extra-typings";
import {
  createRegistry,
  getInputSchema,
  getName,
  listWorkflows,
  runWorkflow,
} from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";
import reviewToMerge from "./workflows/review-to-merge/claude.ts";
import genSpec from "./workflows/gen-spec/claude.ts";

const registry = createRegistry().register(reviewToMerge).register(genSpec);
const program = new Command("my-app");

for (const wf of listWorkflows(registry)) {
  const sub = program.command(getName(wf)).description(wf.description);
  for (const input of getInputSchema(wf)) {
    sub.option(`--${input.name} <value>`, input.description ?? "");
  }
  sub.action(async (rawOpts) => {
    await runWorkflow({ workflow: wf, inputs: rawOpts as Record<string, string> });
  });
}

await program.parseAsync();
```

See [`examples/multi-workflow/`](./examples/multi-workflow) for a complete runnable version — two Claude workflows (`hello`, `goodbye`) registered under one `cli.ts`.

### Programmatic invocation

`runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })` is a plain async function — you don't need a CLI at all:

```ts
import { runWorkflow } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";
import workflow from "./workflows/review-to-merge/claude.ts";

const { id, tmuxSessionName } = await runWorkflow({
  workflow,
  inputs: { target_branch: "main" },
  detach: true,
});
```

Combine with `getSessionStatus(tmuxSessionName)` and `attachSession(id)` to build your own monitoring UI on top of the SDK.

### Embedding under a parent CLI — `runWorkflow` inside any Commander tree

The SDK no longer ships a Commander adapter — it doesn't need one. Just call `runWorkflow` from inside any Commander action:

```ts
import { Command } from "@commander-js/extra-typings";
import { getInputSchema, runWorkflow } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows";
import workflow from "./workflows/deploy/claude.ts";

const program = new Command("my-app");

const deploy = program.command("deploy").description(workflow.description);
for (const input of getInputSchema(workflow)) {
  deploy.option(`--${input.name} <value>`, input.description ?? "");
}
deploy.action(async (rawOpts) => {
  await runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs: rawOpts as Record<string, string> });
});

program.command("hello").action(() => console.log("hi"));

await program.parseAsync();
```

There's no re-entry boilerplate — the SDK ships its own internal orchestrator entry script and re-execs *that* with positional args (`workflowSource`, `agent`, base64-encoded inputs). Your CLI is never re-imported, so there's nothing to guard against orchestrator-mode env vars.

### `WorkflowPicker` component

The interactive picker (the same one `atomic workflow -a claude` opens) is exposed as a component:

```ts
import { WorkflowPicker } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk/workflows/components";
```

Mount it inside your own OpenTUI app or imperatively via `WorkflowPickerPanel.create({ agent, registry })`.

### Registry rules

- `createRegistry()` returns an **immutable** registry. Each `.register(wf)` call returns a **new** registry — the original is unchanged. Chain calls to accumulate workflows.
- Each workflow is keyed by `${agent}/${name}` — the `(agent, name)` pair must be unique. Registering a duplicate throws immediately.
- Builtin workflows (`ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`, `open-claude-design`) are managed by `atomic`'s internal `createBuiltinRegistry()`. They are reserved — user-registered workflows with the same name will not shadow builtins when running the `atomic` CLI.

### Input precedence

`runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })` runs `validateInputs(workflow, inputs)` for you, applying:

1. `defineWorkflow` default values (on each `WorkflowInput`) when no value is provided
2. The first declared enum value when `required: true` and no value is provided
3. Whatever you pass in `inputs`

CLI flags compose entirely at the calling-CLI layer — the SDK only sees the final `inputs` map.

### Builtin workflows via the `atomic` CLI

The `atomic workflow` command runs the built-in registry via the same primitives:

```bash
atomic workflow -n ralph -a claude "Build the auth module"
atomic workflow -n deep-research-codebase -a claude "How does auth work?"
atomic workflow -n open-claude-design -a claude
```

These are not affected by your own `createRegistry()` — they are separate.

### Migration from 0.x (directory-scanning) and the `createWorkflowCli` wrapper

> Two breaking changes: workflows must declare `source: import.meta.path`, and the `createWorkflowCli` / `toCommand` / `runCli` wrappers were removed in favour of primitives.

1. **Add `source: import.meta.path`** to every `defineWorkflow({ ... })` call. The SDK uses it to import the workflow module inside the orchestrator child process.
2. **Replace `createWorkflowCli(workflow).run()`** with a small Commander (or citty / yargs) entrypoint that calls `runWorkflow({ workflow, inputs })` — see the snippets above. The SDK no longer ships a CLI wrapper.
3. **Remove `handleOrchestratorReentry` / `runCli` calls** — the SDK ships its own orchestrator entry script and the dev's CLI is never re-execed.
4. **Update invocations**: replace `atomic workflow -n foo -a claude` with `bun run src/claude-worker.ts --<input>=<value>` for your custom workflows. For the Atomic builtin set (`ralph`, `deep-research-codebase`, `open-claude-design`) keep using `atomic workflow -n <name> -a <agent>`.

### Agent-Specific Files

| Agent          | Folder       | Skills                                          | Context File |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Claude Code    | `.claude/`   | `.claude/skills/` (symlink → `.agents/skills/`) | `CLAUDE.md`  |
| OpenCode       | `.opencode/` | `.agents/skills/`                               | `AGENTS.md`  |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/`   | `.agents/skills/`                               | `AGENTS.md`  |

All three agents share the same skill set via `.agents/skills/`. Claude Code accesses them through a `.claude/skills/` symlink.

## Updating & Uninstalling

### Update

```bash
# Re-running the bootstrap upgrades to the latest stable release in place.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flora131/atomic/main/install.sh | bash         # macOS / Linux
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flora131/atomic/main/install.ps1 | iex                  # Windows PowerShell

# Or if you installed via npm:
bun update -g @bastani/atomic
bun install -g @bastani/atomic@next  # prerelease
```

The first `atomic` run after upgrading auto-syncs tooling deps and global skills — no separate command needed.

### Uninstall

```bash
# macOS / Linux — remove the binary and rc-file PATH/completions hooks
rm -f ~/.local/bin/atomic
sed -i.bak '/# Atomic CLI/,+5d' ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null || true

# Windows — remove the binary; PATH entry persists harmlessly until cleaned manually
Remove-Item -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\atomic" -Recurse -Force

# If installed via npm
bun remove -g @bastani/atomic
```

<details>
<summary><b>Also remove global config and cached agent configs</b></summary>

```bash
# macOS / Linux
rm -rf ~/.atomic/

# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.atomic" -Recurse -Force
```

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Git identity error</b></summary>

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows: agents fail to spawn</b></summary>

Ensure the agent CLI is in your PATH. Atomic uses `Bun.which()`, which handles `.cmd`, `.exe`, and `.bat` extensions automatically.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Why not markdown, a coding agent alone, or a general agent framework?</b></summary>
Markdown is great for guidance: conventions, commands, repo notes, and checklists. Use Claude Code, OpenCode, or Copilot CLI directly for normal single-session coding. Atomic is for the point where the work needs branching, retries, parallel sessions, state, human approval, sandboxed execution, or reliable handoff between stages. General agent frameworks can do some of this, but you often rebuild coding-agent basics yourself: file editing, terminal interaction, MCP setup, hooks, session handling, and repo-specific context. Atomic starts from production coding agents and adds the workflow layer around them.

<summary><b>How does Atomic differ from Spec-Kit?</b></summary>

[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) is GitHub's toolkit for "Spec-Driven Development." Both improve AI-assisted development, but solve different problems:

**In short:** Spec-Kit works well for greenfield projects where you start from a spec and use a single Copilot session to generate code. Atomic is built for the harder case — large existing codebases where you need to research what's already there before changing anything. Atomic gives you multi-session pipelines with isolated context windows, deterministic execution, and support for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Copilot CLI instead of just one agent.

<summary><b>How does Atomic differ from DeerFlow?</b></summary>

[DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) is ByteDance's agent runtime built on LangGraph/LangChain. Both can run multi-agent work, but take different approaches:

**In short:** DeerFlow is a general-purpose agent system with a web UI. Atomic is narrowly focused on coding workflows. The key difference is that Atomic runs on top of production coding agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Copilot CLI) rather than reimplementing coding tools through a generic API — you get each agent's native file editing, permissions, MCP integrations, and hooks out of the box. Atomic also gives you deterministic execution, which matters when encoding a team's dev process.

<summary><b>How does Atomic differ from Hermes Agent?</b></summary>

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is Nous Research's general-purpose AI agent with a self-improving learning loop. Both are open source agent projects, but serve different use cases:

**In short:** Hermes is a broad AI assistant that learns across sessions and connects to messaging platforms. Atomic is coding-specific workflow software for engineering teams. It lets you encode your development process as deterministic TypeScript workflows that run identically across team members, machines, and CI. Atomic inherits production-hardened tools from Claude Code, OpenCode, and Copilot CLI — including their permission systems, MCP integrations, and hooks — giving you two independent security boundaries (devcontainer isolation + agent permissions). Fresh context per session keeps output sharp over multi-hour tasks. Developer-authored skills don't drift the way auto-generated ones can.
