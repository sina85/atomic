/**
 * Build-output structural assertions.
 *
 * Catches packaging regressions in PR CI without needing a full publish
 * cycle. The verdaccio matrix in `publish.yml` exercises the same
 * properties end-to-end across all 6 OS×arch combinations after a
 * release branch is opened — this lighter check fires on every PR so
 * regressions are surfaced before merge.
 *
 * Skip mechanic: set `ATOMIC_SKIP_SDK_BUILD_TEST=1` to bypass when
 * iterating locally (the build adds ~5–10 s to `bun test`). The publish
 * job in `publish.yml` sets this env var because the validate matrix
 * has already exercised the same properties end-to-end.
 *
 * What we verify:
 *   1. `bun run build` produces `dist/cli.js` — the bundled SDK
 *      self-exec target needed at runtime when consumers install
 *      only `@bastani/atomic-sdk`.
 *   2. The build script's entry list is sourced from `package.json#exports`,
 *      so the `./cli` export is present in the published manifest.
 *      Drift between the manifest and the bundle is the most common
 *      way bundled artifacts disappear.
 *   3. `dist/cli.js` is invokable through Bun and dispatches its hidden
 *      Commander subcommands. Catches broken imports, missing default
 *      exports, etc., before the verdaccio matrix runs.
