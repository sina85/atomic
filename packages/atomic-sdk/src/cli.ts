/**
 * SDK-bundled internal CLI dispatcher.
 *
 * The SDK self-execs into a fresh sub-process to spawn long-running pieces
 * of a workflow (orchestrator pane, attached footer, cc-debounce hook). To
 * avoid coupling SDK consumers to the user-facing `@bastani/atomic` CLI
 * package, the SDK ships its own dispatcher right here. `lib/self-exec.ts`
 * resolves to this file by default; consumers may override the resolved
 * path through `runWorkflow({ pathToAtomicExecutable })` (mirrors the
 * Claude Code SDK's `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`).
 *
 * Subcommands handled:
 *   _orchestrator-entry <workflowName> <agent> [inputsB64] [workflowSource]
 *   _cc-debounce <paneId>
 *
 * Compiled-binary mode is intentionally not handled here: when the runtime
 * is a `bun build --compile` of the user-facing CLI, `resolveSdkCliPath()`
 * returns `process.execPath` and the binary's own dispatcher receives the
 * argv. This script only runs when the SDK lives at an installed-package
 * path or in workspace dev mode.
