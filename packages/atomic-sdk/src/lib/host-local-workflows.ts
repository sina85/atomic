/**
 * `hostLocalWorkflows` — explicit host-side dispatch helper.
 *
 * Call this AFTER all `defineWorkflow().compile()` calls in your entry
 * point. It checks `process.argv` for the `_emit-workflow-meta` and
 * `_atomic-run` internal sub-commands and, when found + token-gated,
 * handles them against the `workflows` array you pass in, then exits.
 *
 * Unlike the module-level side-effect in `auto-dispatch.ts`, this runs
 * synchronously after ESM evaluation completes — so the registry is
 * guaranteed to be populated before the dispatch logic inspects it.
 *
 * When neither sub-command is present, or when the dispatch token is
 * absent/invalid, the function returns without side-effects and the
 * caller's own `main()` continues normally.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { defineWorkflow, hostLocalWorkflows } from "@bastani/atomic";
 *
 * const myWorkflow = defineWorkflow({ name: "my-wf" })
 *   .for("claude")
 *   .run(async (ctx) => { ... })
 *   .compile();
 *
 * await hostLocalWorkflows([myWorkflow]);
 * // user main() continues here when not dispatched
 * await main();
 * ```

/**

 * them, and respond to atomic's two internal sub-commands when atomic
 * spawns this CLI as a subprocess. Returns silently on every other
 * `argv` shape so consumers retain complete control of their own CLI
 * surface.
 *
 * Specifically `hostLocalWorkflows`:
 *   1. Registers the supplied `workflows` into a process-local
 *      registry keyed by `(agent, name)` so the orchestrator pane
 *      atomic spawns later can resolve them without requiring an
 *      `export default`.
 *   2. Handles `_emit-workflow-meta` (token-gated) — emits the
 *      metadata line and exits 0.
 *   3. Handles `_atomic-run` (token-gated) — runs the named workflow
 *      via `runWorkflow` and exits 0.
 *
 * Anything else — bare invocation, custom flags from the user's own
 * CLI, etc. — returns silently. If you want to expose your workflow
 * as a standalone CLI for direct invocation, set up your own commander
 * (or any argv parser) AFTER `hostLocalWorkflows`. The two paths don't
 * interfere because atomic's sub-commands are token-gated and exit
 * before your parser runs.
 *
 * Must be called **after** all `.compile()` calls so that `workflows`
 * is fully populated.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Command } from "@commander-js/extra-typings";
 * import { defineWorkflow, hostLocalWorkflows, runWorkflow } from "@bastani/atomic-sdk";
 *
 * const wf = defineWorkflow({ … }).for("claude").run(…).compile();
 *
 * // Atomic dispatch path. Exits if argv is one of atomic's sub-commands.
 * await hostLocalWorkflows([wf]);
 *
 * // The user's own CLI. Whatever shape they want.
 * const program = new Command();
 * program
 *   .option("--path <path>", "file to explain")
 *   .action(async (opts) => { await runWorkflow({ workflow: wf, inputs: opts }); });
 * await program.parseAsync();
 * ```
 *
 * @param workflows - Compiled workflow definitions to expose/dispatch.
 * @param options   - Optional argv/env overrides (useful in tests).
