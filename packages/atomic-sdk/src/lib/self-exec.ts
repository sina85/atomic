/**
 * Helpers for re-executing the atomic CLI as a fresh sub-process.
 *
 * Mirrors OpenCode's single-binary model: every fresh-process entry into
 * atomic goes through `<cli> _<subcommand>`. The launcher emits a
 * platform-appropriate command line that resolves to:
 *
 *   - **Compiled binary**: `<atomic-binary> _<subcommand> <args…>`
 *     (`process.execPath` is the binary itself; argv[0] is the subcommand)
 *
 *   - **Dev / installed-package runtime**: `<bun> <cli.{ts,js}> _<subcommand> <args…>`
 *     (`process.execPath` is the bun interpreter; the CLI script must be
 *     passed explicitly)
 *
 * By default the resolver points at the SDK's *own* bundled dispatcher
 * (`@bastani/atomic-sdk/cli`), so SDK consumers don't need the
 * user-facing `@bastani/atomic` package installed alongside. Resolution
 * is delegated to `import.meta.resolve` — the runtime consults
 * `@bastani/atomic-sdk/package.json#exports` for the canonical mapping
 * (`./cli` → `./src/cli.ts` in dev, `./dist/cli.js` post-publish). No
 * path walks, no hardcoded layout assumptions, no extension guessing.
 *
 * Consumers that prefer to route through their own atomic binary can
 * pass an `override` (wired through
 * `runWorkflow({ pathToAtomicExecutable })`, mirroring the Claude Code
 * SDK's `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`).
 *
 * Centralising the launcher construction here keeps every internal
 * sub-command (`_orchestrator-entry`, `_cc-debounce`, …) on a single
 * code path, so a fix to argv handling or escaping lands in one place
 * rather than drifting across call sites.
