/**
 * Resolved paths to runtime sibling assets (RFC §5.1).
 *
 * `tmuxConfPath` resolves to:
 *
 *  - **Compiled binary**: a `/$bunfs/…` virtual-filesystem path materialised
 *    out to `~/.atomic/runtime/<sdk-version>/tmux.conf` so spawned OS
 *    processes (tmux, psmux) can read it.
 *  - **Dev / installed package**: the absolute on-disk source path.
 *
 * `with { type: "file" }` is the only correct mechanism for asset
 * resolution under `bun build --compile`. Do NOT use `import.meta.dir`
 * inside this module.
 *
 * ### Bunfs materialization
 *
 * In a compiled binary, `with { type: "file" }` returns a `/$bunfs/…`
 * path that is accessible to Bun APIs but NOT to spawned OS processes —
 * `tmux -f /$bunfs/.../tmux.conf` fails with ENOENT. Mirrors the tarball
 * treatment in `packages/atomic/src/lib/embedded-assets.ts`.
 *
 * To bridge that gap we copy the asset to a stable on-disk cache the
 * first time this module loads in a compiled binary. Subsequent loads
 * see an existing destination and skip the write. In dev /
 * installed-package runtime the import already resolves to a real
 * on-disk path, so the helper is a no-op.
 *
 * ### What used to live here
 *
 * Earlier versions of atomic also exported `ccDebounceScriptPath` and
 * `orchestratorEntryPath` — pre-bundled `.script.js` files spawned by
 * tmux as fresh sub-processes. That pattern lifted `@opentui/core`'s
 * dynamic platform-binding import out of the `@opentui/core` package's
 * resolution context and broke at runtime. Following OpenCode's
 * single-binary model, both scripts now live as hidden CLI sub-commands
 * (`atomic _orchestrator-entry`, `atomic _cc-debounce`) that the
 * launcher self-re-execs into. No more standalone bundles, no more
 * materialisation for them.

 * cache dir (`~/.cache`, `~/Library/Caches`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\…\Cache`):
 *
 *  - `~/.cache` and friends are routinely wiped by users / cleanup tools.
 *    A wipe between atomic runs would force a re-extract on next launch
 *    — recoverable, but a needless cost.
 *  - All other atomic state already lives under `~/.atomic` (sessions/,
 *    tmp/, bin/, .synced-version), so keeping runtime assets there gives
 *    operators a single directory to inspect when debugging.
 *
 * Versioning the path lets two atomic versions share the same machine
 * without their assets stomping each other; a stale version directory
 * is a few KB and harmless.
