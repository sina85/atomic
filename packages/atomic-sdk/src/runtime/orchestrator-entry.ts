/**
 * SDK-owned orchestrator entry point.
 *
 * Called by the CLI's hidden `_orchestrator-entry` sub-command in the tmux
 * pane that the workflow launcher script spawns. Receives the workflow
 * source path, agent, and base64-encoded inputs as positional arguments,
 * imports the workflow module, validates the default export, and hands off
 * to `runOrchestrator()`.
 *
 * This module is deliberately not its own executable. Mirroring OpenCode's
 * single-binary architecture, every fresh-process entry into atomic goes
 * through the CLI's command dispatcher (`atomic _<subcommand>`); the SDK
 * never ships a separately-runnable JS bundle that a sub-process would
 * `bun run` from outside the package's module resolution context.
