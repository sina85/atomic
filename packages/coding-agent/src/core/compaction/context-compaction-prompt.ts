Your task is to read relevant parts of a conversation between a user and an AI assistant provided via a transcript file, then run a series of tools to apply deletion-only verbatim compaction using the exact context_delete or context_grep_delete format specified.`;

	return `Reference the provided transcript file transcript and use your search/read tools for small inspections, then use context_delete or context_grep_delete for deletions.

Compaction records deletion targets, not replacement content.
For context_delete, use id-only targets: stable entryId values and optional blockIndex values only.
For context_grep_delete, use a concise literal or regex pattern to select matching entries or blocks; do not paste full transcript entries or content-block bodies.
Do not summarize, paraphrase, or generate replacement context; those are not accepted compaction outputs.
Do not mutate retained transcript objects or content.
Deletion tool calls are the compaction action.

Strategy:
- Start by calling context_compaction_budget to see how much of the context window is full and how much reduction is needed.
- Spend a few turns exploring with search/read tools to gain high confidence of candidate blocks to remove.
- Prefer high-confidence exploit actions after that: delete obvious low-value entries via context_grep_delete or context_delete.
- Use grep deletion for repeated low-value patterns.
- Use exact id deletion for inspected one-off stale entries.
- Check context_compaction_budget after deletion batches to track progress.
- Strict requirement: reduce current context by at least ${targetLabel} before finishing. This is a hard completion gate, not a loose goal.
- Do not send a final plain-text completion message until context_compaction_budget reports at least ${targetLabel} currentReductionPercent.
- If the strict ${targetLabel} reduction is not met yet, continue removing low-value message entries or content blocks with context_delete/context_grep_delete.
- Use the focus query to preserve relevant context: ${JSON.stringify(parameters.query)}.

What Gets Deleted:
- Redundant tool outputs: file reads already acted on, grep/search results already processed, passing test output no longer needed.
- Exploratory dead ends: irrelevant files read, unhelpful or empty searches.
- Verbose boilerplate: license headers, import blocks the agent isn't modifying, configuration files read for reference.
- Superseded information: earlier versions of files that have since been edited, old error messages from bugs already fixed.
- Stale/superseded image context: image content blocks (shown as type "image" / text "[image]") in older tool results, custom messages, or old user-pasted attachments that the agent has already inspected and no longer needs. Image blocks are large (each costs far more tokens than its "[image]" text preview suggests, as reported by context_compaction_budget imageTokenPercent). When images dominate the context, prefer deleting these stale image content blocks before removing useful recent text. Use context_grep_delete with the literal pattern "[image]" and target "content_block" to find image candidates, then confirm they are stale with context_read_entry before deleting. User text blocks remain protected. Old non-recent user image blocks may be deleted only when non-image user content remains in the same entry; old image-only user entries may be deleted as whole entries only when another task-bearing entry remains.

What Survives:
- Active file paths and line numbers: Any reference the agent might need to navigate.
- Current error messages: Unresolved bugs and their exact text.
- Reasoning decisions: Why the agent chose approach A over B. An agent's chain of thought (why it chose this file, what pattern it noticed, what fix it decided on) carries more information-per-token than the raw grep output or file content that informed those decisions.
- Recent tool calls and their results: The last 3-5 operations.
- User instructions: The original task and any clarifications.
- Task-relevant images: Images that are part of the active user task (for example, a screenshot the user just asked about, or the most recent image-bearing result the agent is still acting on). Recent user images and recent tool results are protected by preserve_recent, so do not delete images the agent still needs.

Conditionally Deleted:
- Old reasoning decisions: If there is nothing else to remove and the target reduction is not met, you may omit signed reasoning only as a complete logical assistant tool-use turn sequence. Each provider-visible user-like input starts a turn: a non-empty user/custom input (non-whitespace text or an image), a context-eligible bash execution, or a non-empty branch summary. Empty/whitespace-only user or custom inputs and empty branch summaries do not establish a boundary; whitespace-only branch summaries do because their wrapper is visible. Assistant messages and intervening tool results remain in that turn until the next visible user-like input. Never delete any thinking/redacted_thinking-bearing assistant entry from the current final logical turn; a trailing visible input without an assistant response makes the preceding assistant turn historical. In a completed historical turn, retain all thinking/redacted_thinking-bearing assistant entries or delete all of them as whole entries; never retain a proper subset. Never delete individual content blocks from a retained thinking-bearing assistant message.

<output_format>
Call the context_delete tool one or more times with deletion targets in this shape:
{ "deletions": [{ "kind": "entry", "entryId": "..." }] }

For content-block deletions, use:
{ "kind": "content_block", "entryId": "...", "blockIndex": 0 }

The tool applies and validates deletion targets immediately. You can continue calling it for additional deletions if useful.

For guarded bulk deletion by text match, call context_grep_delete with a literal pattern or regex. It removes valid matching context, silently ignores candidates that validation does not allow so they are not counted as removals, enforces a per-call maxMatches safety cap and optional expectedMatchCount, and validates through the same tool-call/tool-result safety rules. maxMatches only limits one tool call; there is no cumulative cap across corrected or repeated deletion calls.

The full transcript is available as a JSONL file path in the prompt, but do NOT try to load the whole file into context. Use context_search_transcript to find candidate entry IDs and context_read_entry to read only small slices (for example maxChars 1000-4000) before deleting.

When the strict ${targetLabel} reduction requirement is met, reply with a brief plain-text completion message. Do not include deletion target IDs outside tool calls.
