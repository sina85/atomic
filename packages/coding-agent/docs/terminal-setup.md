# Terminal Setup

Atomic uses the [Kitty keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) for reliable modifier key detection. Most modern terminals support this protocol, but some require configuration.

## Kitty, iTerm2

Work out of the box.

## Apple Terminal

Atomic enables enhanced key reporting when available. If Terminal.app still sends plain Return for `SHIFT+Enter`, Atomic uses a local macOS modifier fallback to treat that Return as `SHIFT+Enter`.

This fallback only works when Atomic runs on the same Mac as Terminal.app. It cannot detect the local keyboard over remote SSH.

## Ghostty

Add to your Ghostty config (`~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config` on macOS, `~/.config/ghostty/config` on Linux):

```
keybind = alt+backspace=text:\x1b\x7f
```

Older Claude Code versions may have added this Ghostty mapping:

```
keybind = shift+enter=text:\n
```

That mapping sends a raw linefeed byte. Inside Atomic, that is indistinguishable from `CTRL+J`, so tmux and Atomic no longer see a real `shift+enter` key event.

If Claude Code 2.x or newer is the only reason you added that mapping, you can remove it, unless you want to use Claude Code in tmux, where it still requires that Ghostty mapping.

If you want `SHIFT+Enter` to keep working in tmux via that remap, add `ctrl+j` to your Atomic `tui.input.newLine` keybinding in `~/.atomic/agent/keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "tui.input.newLine": ["shift+enter", "ctrl+j"]
}
```

## WezTerm

WezTerm usually works out of the box for `SHIFT+Enter` via xterm modifyOtherKeys. To use the Kitty keyboard protocol explicitly, create `~/.wezterm.lua`:

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
local config = wezterm.config_builder()
config.enable_kitty_keyboard = true
return config
```

On macOS, WezTerm binds `Option+Enter` to fullscreen by default. To use `Option+Enter` for Atomic follow-up queueing, add this key override:

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
local config = wezterm.config_builder()
config.keys = {
  {
    key = 'Enter',
    mods = 'ALT',
    action = wezterm.action.SendString('\x1b[13;3u'),
  },
}
return config
```

If you already have a `config.keys` table, add the entry to it.

On WSL, WezTerm may require a visible hardware cursor for IME candidate window positioning. If CJK IME candidates do not follow the text cursor, set `ATOMIC_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` before running Atomic or set `showHardwareCursor` to `true` in settings. The legacy `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` alias also works.

## Alacritty

Alacritty usually works out of the box for `SHIFT+Enter`. On macOS, `Option+Enter` may arrive as plain `Enter`. To use `Option+Enter` for Atomic follow-up queueing, add to `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`:

```toml
[[keyboard.bindings]]
key = "Enter"
mods = "Alt"
chars = "\u001b[13;3u"
```

Restart Alacritty after changing the config.

## VS Code (Integrated Terminal)

VS Code 1.109.5 and newer enable Kitty keyboard protocol in the integrated terminal by default, so `SHIFT+Enter` should work out of the box.

VS Code versions older than 1.109.5 need an explicit terminal keybinding for `SHIFT+Enter`.

`keybindings.json` locations:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/keybindings.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\keybindings.json`

Add to `keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "key": "shift+enter",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
  "args": { "text": "\u001b[13;2u" },
  "when": "terminalFocus"
}
```

## Windows Terminal

Add to `settings.json` (CTRL+SHIFT+, or Settings → Open JSON file) to forward the modified Enter keys Atomic uses:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "command": { "action": "sendInput", "input": "\u001b[13;2u" },
      "keys": "shift+enter"
    },
    {
      "command": { "action": "sendInput", "input": "\u001b[13;3u" },
      "keys": "alt+enter"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `SHIFT+Enter` inserts a new line.
- Windows Terminal binds `ALT+Enter` to fullscreen by default. That prevents Atomic from receiving `ALT+Enter` for follow-up queueing.
- Remapping `ALT+Enter` to `sendInput` forwards the real key chord to Atomic instead.

If you already have an `actions` array, add the objects to it. If the old fullscreen behavior persists, fully close and reopen Windows Terminal.

## xfce4-terminal, terminator

These terminals have limited escape sequence support. Modified Enter keys like `CTRL+Enter` and `SHIFT+Enter` cannot be distinguished from plain `Enter`, preventing custom keybindings such as `submit: ["ctrl+enter"]` from working.

For the best experience, use a terminal that supports the Kitty keyboard protocol:
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (requires compilation with Kitty protocol support)

## IntelliJ IDEA (Integrated Terminal)

The built-in terminal has limited escape sequence support. SHIFT+Enter cannot be distinguished from Enter in IntelliJ's terminal.

If you want the hardware cursor visible, set `ATOMIC_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` before running Atomic. The legacy `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` alias also works; the hardware cursor is disabled by default for compatibility.

Consider using a dedicated terminal emulator for the best experience.
