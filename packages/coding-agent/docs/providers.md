# Providers

Atomic supports subscription-based providers via OAuth and API key providers via environment variables or auth file. Atomic knows the available models for each provider, and the list is updated with every Atomic release.

## Subscriptions

Use `/login` in interactive mode, then select a provider:

- ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- Claude Pro/Max
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor (experimental)

Use `/logout` to clear credentials. Tokens are stored in `~/.atomic/agent/auth.json` and auto-refresh when expired.

### OpenAI Codex

- Requires ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription
- Officially endorsed by OpenAI: [Codex for OSS](https://developers.openai.com/community/codex-for-oss)

### Codex Fast Mode

Run `/fast` in interactive mode to enable OpenAI priority service tier separately for normal chat and workflow-stage sessions. The command is shown only when the current model scope includes a supported `openai/*` or `openai-codex/*` model. Workflow stages use the workflow setting, not the chat setting. When enabled for the active supported model, the UI appends `fast` after the model name in the chat footer and workflow stage model labels. Fast mode intentionally does not apply to `github-copilot/*`, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, or custom OpenAI-compatible providers. Use workflow fast mode deliberately because parallel workflow fan-out can multiply priority-tier usage.

### Claude Pro/Max

Anthropic subscription auth is active for Claude Pro/Max accounts. Third-party harness usage draws from [extra usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage) and is billed per token, not against Claude plan limits.

### GitHub Copilot

- Press Enter for github.com, or enter your GitHub Enterprise Server domain
- When using `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of `/login`, Atomic uses the token's `proxy-ep` when present, honors `COPILOT_API_TARGET` or `GITHUB_COPILOT_BASE_URL` overrides, derives the tenant-specific GHE routing host from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL=*.ghe.com`, derives `https://api.enterprise.githubcopilot.com` from other non-`github.com` server URLs, and otherwise falls back to the public Copilot routing hub `https://api.githubcopilot.com` instead of the account-specific individual endpoint.
- If you get "model not supported", enable it in VS Code: Copilot Chat → model selector → select model → "Enable"
- GitHub Copilot models are populated dynamically from Copilot's live CAPI `/models` catalog when Copilot auth is available. Atomic synthesizes only picker-enabled, non-disabled `chat` entries with plain ids (for example `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-5` and `github-copilot/mai-code-1-flash-picker`); namespaced enterprise deployments containing `/` are skipped rather than exposed as `github-copilot/*` models. Models that advertise long-context limits, such as `github-copilot/gpt-5.5`, `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.8`, and `github-copilot/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, expose an opt-in long-context choice through `--context-window`, the `/model` selection flow, per-model `defaultContextWindows`, SDK, and RPC controls. The long-context option advertises the model's full context window (for example `1m` or `1.05m` — GitHub's `max_context_window_tokens`), matching how the native `openai/*` and `anthropic/*` providers report these models and what the chat footer shows. GitHub's lower server-side prompt cap (`max_prompt_tokens`, for example `936k` or `922k`) is retained internally as the effective input budget that drives compaction thresholds and overflow recovery, and GitHub's live output cap (`max_output_tokens`) replaces Atomic's bundled `maxTokens` fallback for provider requests. If CAPI advertises `capabilities.supports.reasoning_effort` as an array, Atomic also gates `/model` and thinking-level cycling to only those live levels for both dynamic Copilot models and bundled `pi-ai` Copilot models; budget-only or boolean-only reasoning metadata leaves the existing thinking map untouched. Active interactive sessions refresh from this metadata as soon as the catalog is applied, so a startup fallback model does not keep stale reasoning levels until restart. This lets Atomic display the branded context window, request the catalog-advertised output budget, and avoid offering unsupported Copilot reasoning levels.
- Selecting long context sets Atomic's displayed window to the model's full capacity while compaction triggers against the effective prompt-token budget, and makes Copilot requests include `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-06-01`. Atomic does not send a body field, `contextTier`, or model-id variant; GitHub automatically applies the server-side `long_context` tier when prompt tokens exceed the default budget.
- Long-context Copilot requests consume more AI credits and require Copilot long-context/usage-based billing entitlement. A prompt that reaches the model's normal prompt cap is compacted and retried automatically. Only when GitHub rejects a prompt *below* that cap — for example because the account lacks the long-context/usage-based billing entitlement and is dropped to a smaller server tier — does Atomic surface a friendly entitlement/server-cap/cost hint rather than silently truncating context.
- **Gemini models** (`github-copilot/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `github-copilot/gemini-3.5-flash`, …) are served through Copilot's CAPI gateway, which re-translates the OpenAI request into Google's GenAI format and enforces Gemini's stricter `FunctionDeclaration` schema (it rejects a tool-parameter `anyOf`/`oneOf` whose branch is a complex object, returning `400 invalid request body`). Atomic automatically sanitizes outbound tool/function JSON Schemas for these models into the supported subset — resolving object/array-bearing unions to their most expressive branch, converting `const`/literal unions to `enum`, collapsing nullable unions to `nullable`, and dropping non-portable keywords such as `additionalProperties`, `patternProperties`, `format`, and numeric/length bounds. Gemini also serializes array/object tool-call **arguments** as flattened indexed keys (`keywords[0]`, `keywords[1]`, …); Atomic reconstructs these back into proper arrays/objects before validation so tool calls (including `structured_output` and MCP tools) don't fail and loop. Both transforms are transparent and scoped to GitHub Copilot Gemini models only; no configuration is required and other providers/models are unaffected.
- **Claude/Anthropic Messages models** served through GitHub Copilot use Copilot SSE transport. If Copilot cleanly ends a `/v1/messages` stream after Anthropic terminal stop-reason evidence but omits the required `message_stop` event, Atomic adds that one terminal event before provider parsing so the turn can finish normally, including when the final complete SSE frame reaches EOF without a trailing blank-line separator. The repair covers public Copilot hosts and GHE tenant routes such as `copilot-api.<enterprise>.ghe.com`, and is otherwise limited to closed, non-error Copilot Anthropic event streams; malformed, truncated, already well-formed, non-Copilot/look-alike host, non-SSE, Gemini, and OpenAI-style streams continue through the normal parser and retry behavior.

### Cursor (experimental)

Cursor support is bundled as the first-party `@bastani/cursor` extension and appears in `/login` as **Cursor (Experimental)**. It uses Cursor's browser PKCE flow and stores OAuth credentials in `~/.atomic/agent/auth.json`; do not paste Cursor tokens into environment variables, command-line arguments, or custom proxies. Atomic identifies as a Cursor CLI-compatible client against private endpoints; maintainers and users should explicitly accept that this may conflict with Cursor's terms of service, stop working without notice, or affect the Cursor account used to authenticate.

Current limitations:

- Cursor uses private, undocumented APIs and Cursor CLI-compatible headers. Atomic prefers the richer `AiService/AvailableModels` RPC and falls back to generated `AgentService/GetUsableModels` when that endpoint or its reverse-engineered fields are unavailable. Endpoint fields can vary by server, account, plan, region, and client version; a live result is an authenticated snapshot, not a universal Cursor catalog.
- Cursor's public Cloud Agents List Models API/SDK is authoritative only for IDs, parameters, and presets accepted by that public surface. It corroborates discovery-first behavior but does not prove private CLI/IDE parity or provide exact context/output limits.
- AvailableModels field 29 supplies parameter names and option labels, while field 30 supplies complete allowed tuples. Atomic caches both, exposes only field-30 tuples, and groups variants only when reasoning effort is their sole difference. Effort-group rows use concise effort-neutral IDs and Cursor's actual display name plus necessary context, Max, thinking, fast, or other mode qualifiers; an arbitrary/default low tuple no longer labels a multi-effort row as `...max-mode-low`. A fixed parameter preset with no selectable effort and no Cursor-marked default retains its exact field-30 route ID rather than receiving a synthetic concise primary route. Advertised `reasoning=none` maps to Atomic `off`, while Cursor's marked/default tuple remains the bare provider-default route.
- Selectable Cursor IDs are distinct from backend routing. Requests preserve the raw server model ID, exact Max flag, and ordered context/thinking/fast/reasoning tuple. Deterministic suffixes resolve concise-ID collisions without losing exact routing, while unambiguous pre-correction synthetic IDs migrate to canonical rows during CLI/default/session resolution and preserve an effort encoded by the alias. Ambiguous aliases and unknown Cursor CLI/session IDs are rejected instead of becoming route-less synthetic models. Every Cursor `--model` reference is checked after authenticated catalog discovery—even when the compatibility snapshot has a fuzzy or exact-looking match—and must equal a current ID or unambiguous alias. Discovery does not consume `session_start`; the real TUI/RPC binding retains its UI-aware lifecycle. Already-qualified models under `--provider`, case-insensitive qualifiers, explicit reasoning/context windows, and concise invalid-context diagnostics are preserved.
- Image capability comes from live model metadata when supplied. Missing capability metadata degrades conservatively to text-only rather than inferring image support from a provider-family name.
- Model metadata uses schema-v2 cache files named `~/.atomic/agent/cursor-model-catalog.json.account-<digest>` for 30 minutes. The scope is a one-way digest of the stable JWT subject—not an OAuth-token hash—and no token or account claim is persisted. Rotated credentials can reuse only the same account's fresh cache; another account cannot load or overwrite it, and legacy unscoped caches are not trusted for authenticated startup. Credential changes refresh immediately, superseded in-process requests cannot overwrite the latest account snapshot, older same-account writes are ignored, and future-dated timestamps are stale. A first-time `/login` completes only after authenticated discovery installs a live catalog for that credential scope; another credential's concurrent refresh cannot satisfy the login, and shutdown cancels pending login discovery. Failures surface as redacted login errors instead of claiming success while estimated compatibility membership remains. `atomic --list-models` awaits stale discovery; a failure prints a warning and lists the retained scoped catalog. Successful live registration is independent of best-effort persistence, whose failures remain diagnostic.
- Exact normal/Max context and output values are used only when attached together to the corresponding discovered model/mode, rather than independently maximizing fields across variants. Where Cursor does not supply a value, Atomic uses a positive operational budget required by the provider interface and labels its provenance as a conservative fallback with the exact limit unknown; it does not derive universal limits from pricing, display-name markers, fallback-ID suffixes, or a similarly named provider model. The bundled static snapshot is compatibility-only and includes a conservative GPT-5.5 base entry, not invented capabilities or parameter combinations.
- User images and mixed text/image MCP tool results are serialized for models whose current metadata advertises image input. Image payloads must be non-empty standard base64; MIME-style line wrapping whitespace is accepted and stripped.
- The implementation avoids a localhost proxy and keeps credentials OAuth-only. Cursor's HTTP/2 transport uses bundled `@bastani/atomic-natives`; request encoding sends the discovered backend model ID through both legacy `ModelDetails` and generated `RequestedModel` fields, including the exact advertised parameters and Max-mode state without recombining presets. A new request fails if exact route metadata is missing instead of silently sending a picker/display ID.
- Cursor request encoding intentionally omits a `previousWorkspaceUris` current-directory entry so local absolute working-directory paths are not sent as workspace context.

Select models as `cursor/<model-id>` (default: `cursor/composer-2`).

## API Keys

Reference for environment variables and `auth.json` keys: `findEnvKeys()` / `getEnvApiKey()` in the installed `@earendil-works/pi-ai` dependency (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/env-api-keys.d.ts`). The private provider map those functions use is in `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/env-api-keys.js`; Atomic does not include a separate `packages/ai` source directory in this monorepo.

#### Auth File

Store credentials in `~/.atomic/agent/auth.json`:

```json
{
  "anthropic": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-ant-..." },
  "ant-ling": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "openai": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-..." },
  "deepseek": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-..." },
  "nvidia": { "type": "api_key", "key": "nvapi-..." },
  "google": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "opencode": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "opencode-go": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "together": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi-token-plan-cn":  { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi-token-plan-ams": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi-token-plan-sgp": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." }
}
```

The file is created with `0600` permissions (user read/write only). Auth file credentials take priority over environment variables.

### Key Resolution

The `key` field supports command execution, environment interpolation, and literals:

- **Shell command:** `"!command"` at the start executes the whole value as a command and uses stdout (cached for process lifetime)
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "!security find-generic-password -ws 'anthropic'" }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "!op read 'op://vault/item/credential'" }
  ```
- **Environment interpolation:** `"$ENV_VAR"` or `"${ENV_VAR}"` uses the value of the named variable. Interpolation works inside larger literals.
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "$MY_ANTHROPIC_KEY" }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "${KEY_PREFIX}_${KEY_SUFFIX}" }
  ```
  `$FOO_BAR` is the variable `FOO_BAR`; use `${FOO}_BAR` when `BAR` is literal text. Missing environment variables make the value unresolved.
- **Escapes:** `"$$"` emits a literal `"$"`; `"$!"` emits a literal `"!"` without triggering command execution.
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "$$literal-dollar-prefix" }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "$!literal-bang-prefix" }
  ```
- **Literal value:** Used directly
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-ant-..." }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "public" }
  ```

Legacy uppercase env-var-like values such as `MY_API_KEY` are migrated to `$MY_API_KEY` on startup only when that environment variable is present during migration; otherwise the value is preserved as a literal. The same explicit `$ENV_VAR` rule and guarded legacy migration apply to custom provider `apiKey` and header values in `models.json`; see [Custom Models](/models). OAuth credentials are also stored here after `/login` and managed automatically.

## Cloud Providers

### Azure OpenAI

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
# also supported: https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
# root endpoints are auto-normalized to /openai/v1
# or use resource name instead of base URL
export AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_NAME=your-resource

# Optional
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-01
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_MAP=gpt-4=my-gpt4,gpt-4o=my-gpt4o
```

### Amazon Bedrock

```bash
# Option 1: AWS Profile
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile

# Option 2: IAM Keys
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Option 3: Bearer Token
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...

# Optional region (defaults to us-east-1)
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

Also supports ECS task roles (`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_*`) and IRSA (`AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`).

```bash
atomic --provider amazon-bedrock --model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
```

Prompt caching is enabled automatically for Claude models whose ID contains a recognizable model name (base models and system-defined inference profiles). For application inference profiles (whose ARNs don't contain the model name), set `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1` to enable cache points:

```bash
export AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1
atomic --provider amazon-bedrock --model arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123456789012:application-inference-profile/abc123
```

If you are connecting to a Bedrock API proxy, the following environment variables can be used:

```bash
# Set the URL for the Bedrock proxy (standard AWS SDK env var)
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME=https://my.corp.proxy/bedrock

# Set if your proxy does not require authentication
export AWS_BEDROCK_SKIP_AUTH=1

# Set if your proxy only supports HTTP/1.1
export AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_HTTP1=1
```

### Cloudflare AI Gateway

`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` can be set via `/login`. The account ID and gateway slug must be set as environment variables.

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...           # or use /login
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
export CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID=...        # create at dash.cloudflare.com → AI → AI Gateway
atomic --provider cloudflare-ai-gateway --model "claude-sonnet-4-5"
```

Routes to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Workers AI through Cloudflare AI Gateway. Workers AI uses the Unified API (`/compat`) and prefixed model IDs (`workers-ai/@cf/...`). OpenAI uses the OpenAI passthrough route (`/openai`) with native OpenAI model IDs such as `gpt-5.1`. Anthropic uses the Anthropic passthrough route (`/anthropic`) with native Anthropic model IDs such as `claude-sonnet-4-5`.

AI Gateway authentication uses `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` as `cf-aig-authorization`. Upstream authentication can be one of:

| Mode | Request auth | Upstream auth |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Workers AI | Cloudflare token only | Cloudflare-native |
| Unified billing | Cloudflare token only | Cloudflare handles upstream auth and deducts credits |
| Stored BYOK | Cloudflare token only | Cloudflare injects provider keys stored in the AI Gateway dashboard |
| Inline BYOK | Cloudflare token plus upstream `Authorization` header | The request supplies the upstream provider key |

For normal Atomic usage, prefer unified billing or stored BYOK. Inline BYOK requires configuring an additional upstream `Authorization` header for the Cloudflare AI Gateway provider, for example via a `models.json` provider/model override.

### Cloudflare Workers AI

`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` can be set via `/login`. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` must be set as an environment variable.

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...           # or use /login
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
atomic --provider cloudflare-workers-ai --model "@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"
```

Atomic automatically sets `x-session-affinity` for [prefix caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/prompt-caching/) discounts.

### Google Vertex AI

Uses Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
```

Or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a service account key file.

## Custom Providers

**Via models.json:** Add Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or any provider that speaks a supported API (OpenAI Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, Google Generative AI). See [Custom models](/models).

**Via extensions:** For providers that need custom API implementations or OAuth flows, create an extension. See [Custom providers](/custom-provider) and [examples/extensions/custom-provider-gitlab-duo](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/custom-provider-gitlab-duo).

## Resolution Order

When resolving credentials for a provider:

1. CLI `--api-key` flag
2. `auth.json` entry (API key or OAuth token)
3. Environment variable
4. Custom provider keys from `models.json`
