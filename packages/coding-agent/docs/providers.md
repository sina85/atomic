# Providers

Atomic supports subscription-based providers via OAuth and API key providers via environment variables or auth file. Atomic knows the available models for each provider, and the list is updated with every Atomic release.

## Table of Contents

- [Subscriptions](#subscriptions)
- [API Keys](#api-keys)
- [Auth File](#auth-file)
- [Cloud Providers](#cloud-providers)
- [Custom Providers](#custom-providers)
- [Resolution Order](#resolution-order)

## Subscriptions

Use `/login` in interactive mode, then select a provider:

- ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- Claude Pro/Max
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor (experimental)

Use `/logout` to clear credentials. Tokens are stored in `~/.atomic/agent/auth.json` and auto-refresh when expired.

### OpenAI Codex

- Requires ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription
- Officially endorsed by OpenAI: [Codex for OSS](https://developers.openai.com/community/codex-for-oss)

### Codex Fast Mode

Run `/fast` in interactive mode to enable OpenAI priority service tier separately for normal chat and workflow-stage sessions. The command is shown only when the current model scope includes a supported `openai/*` or `openai-codex/*` model. Workflow stages use the workflow setting, not the chat setting. When enabled for the active supported model, the UI appends `fast` after the model name in the chat footer and workflow stage model labels. Fast mode intentionally does not apply to `github-copilot/*`, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, or custom OpenAI-compatible providers. Use workflow fast mode deliberately because parallel workflow fan-out can multiply priority-tier usage.

### Claude Pro/Max

Anthropic subscription auth is active for Claude Pro/Max accounts. Third-party harness usage draws from [extra usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage) and is billed per token, not against Claude plan limits.

### GitHub Copilot

- Press Enter for github.com, or enter your GitHub Enterprise Server domain
- When using `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of `/login`, Atomic uses the token's `proxy-ep` when present, honors `COPILOT_API_TARGET` or `GITHUB_COPILOT_BASE_URL` overrides, derives the tenant-specific GHE routing host from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL=*.ghe.com`, derives `https://api.enterprise.githubcopilot.com` from other non-`github.com` server URLs, and otherwise falls back to the public Copilot routing hub `https://api.githubcopilot.com` instead of the account-specific individual endpoint.
- If you get "model not supported", enable it in VS Code: Copilot Chat → model selector → select model → "Enable"
- GitHub Copilot models are populated dynamically from Copilot's live CAPI `/models` catalog when Copilot auth is available. Atomic synthesizes only picker-enabled, non-disabled `chat` entries with plain ids (for example `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-5` and `github-copilot/mai-code-1-flash-picker`); namespaced enterprise deployments containing `/` are skipped rather than exposed as `github-copilot/*` models. Models that advertise long-context limits, such as `github-copilot/gpt-5.5`, `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.8`, and `github-copilot/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, expose an opt-in long-context choice through `--context-window`, the `/model` selection flow, per-model `defaultContextWindows`, SDK, and RPC controls. The long-context option advertises the model's full context window (for example `1m` or `1.05m` — GitHub's `max_context_window_tokens`), matching how the native `openai/*` and `anthropic/*` providers report these models and what the chat footer shows. GitHub's lower server-side prompt cap (`max_prompt_tokens`, for example `936k` or `922k`) is retained internally as the effective input budget that drives compaction thresholds and overflow recovery, and GitHub's live output cap (`max_output_tokens`) replaces Atomic's bundled `maxTokens` fallback for provider requests. If CAPI advertises `capabilities.supports.reasoning_effort` as an array, Atomic also gates `/model` and thinking-level cycling to only those live levels for both dynamic Copilot models and bundled `pi-ai` Copilot models; budget-only or boolean-only reasoning metadata leaves the existing thinking map untouched. Active interactive sessions refresh from this metadata as soon as the catalog is applied, so a startup fallback model does not keep stale reasoning levels until restart. This lets Atomic display the branded context window, request the catalog-advertised output budget, and avoid offering unsupported Copilot reasoning levels.
- Selecting long context sets Atomic's displayed window to the model's full capacity while compaction triggers against the effective prompt-token budget, and makes Copilot requests include `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-06-01`. Atomic does not send a body field, `contextTier`, or model-id variant; GitHub automatically applies the server-side `long_context` tier when prompt tokens exceed the default budget.
- Long-context Copilot requests consume more AI credits and require Copilot long-context/usage-based billing entitlement. A prompt that reaches the model's normal prompt cap is compacted and retried automatically. Only when GitHub rejects a prompt *below* that cap — for example because the account lacks the long-context/usage-based billing entitlement and is dropped to a smaller server tier — does Atomic surface a friendly entitlement/server-cap/cost hint rather than silently truncating context.
- **Gemini models** (`github-copilot/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `github-copilot/gemini-3.5-flash`, …) are served through Copilot's CAPI gateway, which re-translates the OpenAI request into Google's GenAI format and enforces Gemini's stricter `FunctionDeclaration` schema (it rejects a tool-parameter `anyOf`/`oneOf` whose branch is a complex object, returning `400 invalid request body`). Atomic automatically sanitizes outbound tool/function JSON Schemas for these models into the supported subset — resolving object/array-bearing unions to their most expressive branch, converting `const`/literal unions to `enum`, collapsing nullable unions to `nullable`, and dropping non-portable keywords such as `additionalProperties`, `patternProperties`, `format`, and numeric/length bounds. Gemini also serializes array/object tool-call **arguments** as flattened indexed keys (`keywords[0]`, `keywords[1]`, …); Atomic reconstructs these back into proper arrays/objects before validation so tool calls (including `structured_output` and MCP tools) don't fail and loop. Both transforms are transparent and scoped to GitHub Copilot Gemini models only; no configuration is required and other providers/models are unaffected.
- **Claude/Anthropic Messages models** served through GitHub Copilot use Copilot SSE transport. If Copilot cleanly ends a `/v1/messages` stream after Anthropic terminal stop-reason evidence but omits the required `message_stop` event, Atomic adds that one terminal event before provider parsing so the turn can finish normally, including when the final complete SSE frame reaches EOF without a trailing blank-line separator. The repair covers public Copilot hosts and GHE tenant routes such as `copilot-api.<enterprise>.ghe.com`, and is otherwise limited to closed, non-error Copilot Anthropic event streams; malformed, truncated, already well-formed, non-Copilot/look-alike host, non-SSE, Gemini, and OpenAI-style streams continue through the normal parser and retry behavior.

### Cursor (experimental)

Cursor support is bundled as the first-party `@bastani/cursor` extension and appears in `/login` as **Cursor (Experimental)**. The supported bundled path uses Cursor's browser PKCE flow and stores OAuth credentials in `~/.atomic/agent/auth.json`; do not copy Cursor tokens into environment variables, command-line arguments, logs, or custom proxies. Low-level adapters and injectable resolvers can supply credentials directly, so Atomic cannot prevent external code from placing a token elsewhere. Atomic identifies as a Cursor CLI-compatible client against private endpoints; maintainers and users should explicitly accept that this may conflict with Cursor's terms of service, stop working without notice, or affect the Cursor account used to authenticate.

Current limitations and behavior:

- Cursor uses private, undocumented APIs and CLI-compatible headers. `AgentService/GetUsableModels` is the sole authority for the authenticated account's runnable existence, exact route IDs, display data, and Max state. Atomic preserves one row per returned GetUsable row in source order, including blank, whitespace-only, and duplicate IDs; the result is an account snapshot, not a universal Cursor catalog. Raw textual exact lookup selects the first duplicate occurrence without trimming, ambiguity rejection, suffix/context parsing, or rewriting. A selected later in-memory model object survives workflow validation and catalog refresh with that current occurrence's routing metadata; persisted provider/ID-only references intentionally restore the first occurrence.
- The selected flat ID is sent unchanged in both `ModelDetails.model_id` and `RequestedModel.model_id`. GetUsable Max state is sent in both structures, and `RequestedModel.parameters` is empty. Atomic does not expand AvailableModels tuples, synthesize backend/picker routes, or expose a reasoning selector that would rewrite the selected route.
- `AiService/AvailableModels` is a separate best-effort image-metadata call whose decoder preserves explicit blank/whitespace identities, ordered duplicate variants, optional image flags, and identityless parent rows without fabricating omitted strings. One or more same-account exact identity/variant matches add image input only when every match explicitly reports true; duplicate or distinct agreeing evidence remains unambiguous, while any false or omitted match is text-only. AvailableModels cannot add, remove, reorder, or collapse GetUsable rows, select an ID, provide display/Max/parameters, or block text usage; no model-family heuristic is used.
- Cursor is experimental, and this catalog rewrite intentionally breaks older experimental IDs. Saved settings, CLI references, `--models`/enabled-model scopes, workflows, and restored sessions must use an exact current GetUsable ID. Cursor-specific behavior also requires the raw provider identity to be exactly lowercase `cursor`: workflow strings use the literal prefix `cursor/<raw-id>`, and saved/session/default/object identities use provider `cursor`. Provider case or whitespace variants are ordinary non-Cursor identities and are never normalized into Cursor discovery, reselection errors, or execution authority. Every route byte—including blank IDs and suffix/context-looking text—is preserved without generic trimming or rewriting. A bare (non-qualified) reference is an ordinary non-Cursor value resolved by the generic matchers; only an explicit lowercase `cursor/<id>` targets a Cursor route, so a lowercase `cursor/<id>` with no live route is a terminal reselection failure rather than a fall-through to a same-named custom row, and Atomic retains no static list of historical Cursor IDs. Strict workflow preflight and stage resolution require authenticated discovery before reading listed rows; a list-only stale row is never enough. Strict Cursor scope failures are fatal during synchronous and deferred interactive startup, so Atomic never continues prompting on a default or current model outside the requested scope; enabled-model scope recovery keeps a current in-scope selection or the saved default (only an omitted default is absent) before falling back to the first scoped entry. A settings-only exact Cursor default is retried after deferred extensions load—the deferred interactive path is non-fatal until that retry—while an explicit selection or restored session identity keeps precedence. Explicitly qualified non-Cursor IDs retain their normal meaning. There is no alias, nearest-effort, static, AvailableModels, provider, or other-model fallback.
- `--models` entries and ordered main-chat fallback references preserve literal Cursor route bytes after comma/list parsing; exact lowercase `cursor/` routes are attempted before generic non-Cursor trimming or thinking/context parsing. Qualifier lookalikes remain ordinary non-Cursor text. Separate `--provider cursor --model ""` and saved defaults may select an authoritative blank route ID; only an omitted model value is treated as absent.
- Model metadata uses schema-v3 cache files named `~/.atomic/agent/cursor-model-catalog.json.account-<digest>` for 30 minutes. They preserve the ordered GetUsable row sequence—including blank, whitespace-only, and duplicate IDs—plus optional same-account image flags. Schema-v1, schema-v2, unscoped, and parameterized caches are ignored rather than migrated. The scope is a one-way digest of the stable JWT subject—not an OAuth-token hash—and no token or account claim is persisted. Rotated credentials may reuse only a fresh snapshot for the same account; only that fresh v3 snapshot may bridge a temporary GetUsable failure. Cache saves and invalidations are ordered independently per account: a pending invalidation blocks same-account loads, newer saves wait for earlier clears, and a later clear remains final without blocking another account. A later same-account save with an equal `fetchedAt` timestamp follows that invocation order and replaces the earlier record; only a strictly older timestamp is rejected. Stale snapshots, AvailableModels data, and static rows are never executable fallback.
- Credential changes refresh immediately, superseded/out-of-order refreshes cannot overwrite newer state, and future timestamps are stale. Stored and execution credential lookups are epoch-fenced before discovery, cache, catalog, authority, status, or warning effects. A superseded or post-disposal result is inert; a current missing or failed execution lookup revokes rows, the scoped cache, authority, and active leases with a fixed sanitized diagnostic. Caller cancellation and disposal detach pending first or second resolver waits; late outcomes remain observed and inert, and transport is never invoked once an abort is visible before Run. An authorization failure or caller abort that occurs before a paused tool turn is resumed surfaces an error but preserves that paused turn for a later authorized retry; only a failure once the resume has begun cleans up the resumed attempt. Execution is authorized against the host-selected account's current TTL-valid exact route and selected catalog occurrence: when the host credential scope changes, execution removes the previous rows and joins the selected account's cache/GetUsable refresh, while stale credentials cannot establish or roll back authority. A bounded lease-expiry timer actively aborts silent active and paused streams at TTL, unregisters expired rows, clears that scoped cache/freshness state, and requires rediscovery; inbound messages are rechecked before output, paused tool results recheck before every write, and aborted turns are removed. Account, published generation, route occurrence, image metadata, or Max changes revoke the same opaque lease. HTTP/2 Run streams release local codec/open-stream bookkeeping before awaiting remote close or cancellation; provider/session disposal detaches turn and cleanup bookkeeping immediately and waits only for a bounded grace, so never-settling remote cleanup cannot hang shutdown. A first-time `/login` completes only after the credential scope has a usable authenticated catalog; shutdown cancels pending discovery and errors are redacted. `atomic --list-models` awaits required discovery, while live registration remains usable if best-effort persistence fails.
- Only current-turn user images and live mixed text/image MCP tool results retain strict serialization for image-capable routes. Earlier-turn image blocks are omitted while their surrounding text/tool continuity remains. Current payloads must be non-empty canonical standard base64 after ASCII whitespace is stripped. The MIME string is forwarded without allowlist validation; known image MIME types receive conventional filename extensions and other MIME values use `.img`. Reconstructing earlier images and structured clipboard attachments are deferred to [#1807](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1807); assistant-generated images are out of scope.
- The implementation avoids a localhost proxy, keeps tokens and account claims out of the account-scoped catalog cache, uses private cache permissions, sanitizes known transport diagnostics, uses bundled `@bastani/atomic-natives` for HTTP/2, and intentionally omits a `previousWorkspaceUris` current-directory entry so local absolute working-directory paths are not sent as workspace context.

Select models as `cursor/<exact-getusable-model-id>` after login; use `/model` to see the current account's routes.

## API Keys

Reference for environment variables and `auth.json` keys: `findEnvKeys()` / `getEnvApiKey()` in the installed `@earendil-works/pi-ai` dependency (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/env-api-keys.d.ts`). The private provider map those functions use is in `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/env-api-keys.js`; Atomic does not include a separate `packages/ai` source directory in this monorepo.

#### Auth File

Store credentials in `~/.atomic/agent/auth.json`:

```json
{
  "anthropic": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-ant-..." },
  "ant-ling": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "openai": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-..." },
  "deepseek": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-..." },
  "nvidia": { "type": "api_key", "key": "nvapi-..." },
  "google": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "opencode": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "opencode-go": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "together": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi-token-plan-cn":  { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi-token-plan-ams": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." },
  "xiaomi-token-plan-sgp": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." }
}
```

The file is created with `0600` permissions (user read/write only). Auth file credentials take priority over environment variables.

### Key Resolution

The `key` field supports command execution, environment interpolation, and literals:

- **Shell command:** `"!command"` at the start executes the whole value as a command and uses stdout (cached for process lifetime)
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "!security find-generic-password -ws 'anthropic'" }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "!op read 'op://vault/item/credential'" }
  ```
- **Environment interpolation:** `"$ENV_VAR"` or `"${ENV_VAR}"` uses the value of the named variable. Interpolation works inside larger literals.
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "$MY_ANTHROPIC_KEY" }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "${KEY_PREFIX}_${KEY_SUFFIX}" }
  ```
  `$FOO_BAR` is the variable `FOO_BAR`; use `${FOO}_BAR` when `BAR` is literal text. Missing environment variables make the value unresolved.
- **Escapes:** `"$$"` emits a literal `"$"`; `"$!"` emits a literal `"!"` without triggering command execution.
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "$$literal-dollar-prefix" }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "$!literal-bang-prefix" }
  ```
- **Literal value:** Used directly
  ```json
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-ant-..." }
  { "type": "api_key", "key": "public" }
  ```

Legacy uppercase env-var-like values such as `MY_API_KEY` are migrated to `$MY_API_KEY` on startup only when that environment variable is present during migration; otherwise the value is preserved as a literal. The same explicit `$ENV_VAR` rule and guarded legacy migration apply to custom provider `apiKey` and header values in `models.json`; see [Custom Models](/models). OAuth credentials are also stored here after `/login` and managed automatically.

## Cloud Providers

### Azure OpenAI

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
# also supported: https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
# root endpoints are auto-normalized to /openai/v1
# or use resource name instead of base URL
export AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_NAME=your-resource

# Optional
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-01
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_MAP=gpt-4=my-gpt4,gpt-4o=my-gpt4o
```

### Amazon Bedrock

```bash
# Option 1: AWS Profile
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile

# Option 2: IAM Keys
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Option 3: Bearer Token
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...

# Optional region (defaults to us-east-1)
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

Also supports ECS task roles (`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_*`) and IRSA (`AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`).

```bash
atomic --provider amazon-bedrock --model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
```

Prompt caching is enabled automatically for Claude models whose ID contains a recognizable model name (base models and system-defined inference profiles). For application inference profiles (whose ARNs don't contain the model name), set `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1` to enable cache points:

```bash
export AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1
atomic --provider amazon-bedrock --model arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123456789012:application-inference-profile/abc123
```

If you are connecting to a Bedrock API proxy, the following environment variables can be used:

```bash
# Set the URL for the Bedrock proxy (standard AWS SDK env var)
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME=https://my.corp.proxy/bedrock

# Set if your proxy does not require authentication
export AWS_BEDROCK_SKIP_AUTH=1

# Set if your proxy only supports HTTP/1.1
export AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_HTTP1=1
```

### Cloudflare AI Gateway

`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` can be set via `/login`. The account ID and gateway slug must be set as environment variables.

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...           # or use /login
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
export CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID=...        # create at dash.cloudflare.com → AI → AI Gateway
atomic --provider cloudflare-ai-gateway --model "claude-sonnet-4-5"
```

Routes to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Workers AI through Cloudflare AI Gateway. Workers AI uses the Unified API (`/compat`) and prefixed model IDs (`workers-ai/@cf/...`). OpenAI uses the OpenAI passthrough route (`/openai`) with native OpenAI model IDs such as `gpt-5.1`. Anthropic uses the Anthropic passthrough route (`/anthropic`) with native Anthropic model IDs such as `claude-sonnet-4-5`.

AI Gateway authentication uses `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` as `cf-aig-authorization`. Upstream authentication can be one of:

| Mode | Request auth | Upstream auth |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Workers AI | Cloudflare token only | Cloudflare-native |
| Unified billing | Cloudflare token only | Cloudflare handles upstream auth and deducts credits |
| Stored BYOK | Cloudflare token only | Cloudflare injects provider keys stored in the AI Gateway dashboard |
| Inline BYOK | Cloudflare token plus upstream `Authorization` header | The request supplies the upstream provider key |

For normal Atomic usage, prefer unified billing or stored BYOK. Inline BYOK requires configuring an additional upstream `Authorization` header for the Cloudflare AI Gateway provider, for example via a `models.json` provider/model override.

### Cloudflare Workers AI

`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` can be set via `/login`. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` must be set as an environment variable.

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...           # or use /login
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
atomic --provider cloudflare-workers-ai --model "@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"
```

Atomic automatically sets `x-session-affinity` for [prefix caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/prompt-caching/) discounts.

### Google Vertex AI

Uses Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
```

Or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to a service account key file.

## Custom Providers

**Via models.json:** Add Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or any provider that speaks a supported API (OpenAI Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, Google Generative AI). See [Custom models](/models).

**Via extensions:** For providers that need custom API implementations or OAuth flows, create an extension. See [Custom providers](/custom-provider) and [examples/extensions/custom-provider-gitlab-duo](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/custom-provider-gitlab-duo).

## Resolution Order

When resolving credentials for a provider:

1. CLI `--api-key` flag
2. `auth.json` entry (API key or OAuth token)
3. Environment variable
4. Custom provider keys from `models.json`
