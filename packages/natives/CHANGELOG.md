# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added a Rust-backed `PtySession` N-API surface using `portable-pty`, enabling Atomic `bash` calls with `pty: true` to run through a real PTY/ConPTY with streaming output, resize, kill, timeout, cwd, shell, and environment support.
- Added native `glob`, `grep`, in-memory `search`, `hasMatch`, and filesystem scan-cache invalidation bindings for Atomic's full-level `find`/`search` tool parity.

### Changed

- Refreshed the native build toolchain and transitive Rust dependencies, including `@napi-rs/cli` 3.7.2, `rustls` 0.23.41, `napi` 3.9.4, `bytes` 1.12.0, and `webpki-roots` 1.0.8.

## [0.9.3-alpha.6] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Published a synchronized Atomic 0.9.3-alpha.6 prerelease for the native transport package; no native transport changes were made after 0.9.3-alpha.5.

## [0.9.3-alpha.5] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- Bumped the native build toolchain devDependency `@napi-rs/cli` from 3.7.0 to 3.7.2 (includes the Node 12-compatible CJS binding-loader fix and an esbuild 0.28.1 security update), and refreshed transitive Cargo crates used by the `@bastani/atomic-natives` Rust build: `rustls` 0.23.40 → 0.23.41, `napi` 3.9.2 → 3.9.4, `bytes` 1.11.1 → 1.12.0, and `webpki-roots` 1.0.7 → 1.0.8 (the latter removing the Mozilla-deprecated `SecureSign Root CA12` root). No native transport source changes were needed.

- Added oh-my-pi-derived native `glob`, `grep`, in-memory `search`, `hasMatch`, and filesystem scan-cache invalidation N-API bindings for Atomic's full-level `find`/`search` tool parity, backed by the Rust `ignore`, `globset`, and ripgrep crates ([#1483](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1483)).
