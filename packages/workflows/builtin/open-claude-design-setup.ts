/**
 * open-claude-design setup helpers.
 *
 * Capabilities that delegate to the accessible `impeccable` skill
 * (`/skill:impeccable …`), factored into this module so the runner and phases
 * files stay under the 500-line file-length gate:
 *
 *   1. Discovery + init front door: one `discovery` stage runs
 *      `/skill:impeccable shape` and `/skill:impeccable init`, interviews the
 *      user for the design brief/output type/references, then lets impeccable
 *      detect/create/reconcile PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md in the same stage.
 *   2. Reference discovery: browse five curated galleries (Awwwards,
 *      recent.design, Dribbble, Monet, Motionsites) and synthesize a references
 *      brief the generator heavily emulates.
 *   3. Live interactive QA prompt: drive `/skill:impeccable live` against the
 *      static preview.html so the user picks elements, annotates, and accepts
 *      on-brand variants in the browser. cross-ref: impeccable `reference/live.md`.
