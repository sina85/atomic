/**
 * Builtin workflow: open-claude-design
 *
 * Adapts Atomic SDK's Claude Design workflow to the local workflow SDK:
 * design-system onboarding, reference import, generation, bounded refinement,
 * enforcement, and export/handoff all run through ctx.task()/ctx.parallel().
 *
 * Every stage prompt invokes the specific impeccable sub-skill that maps to
 * its role (see https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable/tree/main/site/content/skills):
 *
 *   onboarding     → impeccable `document` / `extract` / `audit`
 *   import         → impeccable `extract`
 *   generator      → impeccable `craft` (HTML preview)
 *   user-feedback  → impeccable `critique` (against the live HTML preview)
 *   critique-N     → impeccable `critique`
 *   screenshot-N   → impeccable `audit` + `live`
 *   apply-changes  → impeccable `polish`
 *   pre-export     → impeccable `audit`
 *   forced-fix     → impeccable `harden`
 *   exporter       → impeccable `document` (rich HTML spec)
 *
 * The refinement loop has been re-shaped so that the artifact under review is
 * a real HTML page on disk (`preview.html`). The workflow attempts to open it
 * through `browser-use` so the user can interactively review and annotate;
 * when browser-use is unavailable, the file path is surfaced so the user
 * can open it manually. The final exporter produces a rich `spec.html` that
 * embeds the agreed-upon design alongside the implementation handoff.
