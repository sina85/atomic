## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- Removed legacy workflow import declarations by registered workflow name or path object. Workflows must now use normal TypeScript imports and pass compiled workflow definitions to `.import(workflow, { as? })`.

### Added

- Added TypeScript module-style workflow imports: `.import(compiledWorkflow, { as? })` registers the imported workflow's name for `ctx.workflow(...)`, while the bundled `deep-research-codebase`, `goal`, and `ralph` workflows are reusable from `@bastani/workflows/builtin` or individual builtin module paths.
- Added first-class workflow imports for composition: workflows can declare `.import()` dependencies, child workflows can declare `.output()` contracts, discovery validates unresolved/circular/invalid import graphs, and `ctx.workflow()` runs imported workflows as nested runs with input validation, output selection/mapping, and a visible parent boundary stage ([#1071](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1071)).
- Added explicit workflow interaction metadata through `defineWorkflow(...).humanInTheLoop(reason?)` and a runtime execution policy that distinguishes interactive from non-interactive workflow runs ([#1123](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1123)).

### Changed

- Render workflow stage notices, lifecycle notices, and HiL answer notices as compact emoji-free TUI cards instead of plain wrapped rows, matching the debugger warning card treatment.
- Updated the registered `workflow` tool description so agent-facing metadata covers named and direct runs, discovery, inspection, prompt answering/steering, run control, and reload ([#1151](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1151)).

### Fixed

- Fixed bundled workflow modules so they import the leaf `defineWorkflow` authoring API instead of the public package entrypoint, avoiding an ESM initialization cycle during builtin workflow discovery.
- Fixed workflow HIL prompts so awaiting-input and answered-prompt notices no longer wake the main chat agent, answer notices stay out of LLM context and explicitly forbid auto-answering later HIL prompts, and stale Enter input from graph/connect focus transitions is quarantined when prompts appear after the attach pane is already open, covering input, confirm, select, and editor prompts ([#1163](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1163)).
- Fixed workflow run widgets so store changes and elapsed-time ticks repaint through a long-lived reactive widget instead of waiting for unrelated chat input or remounting the widget ([#1150](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1150)).
- Fixed `/workflow reload` and `workflow({ action: "reload" })` so newly added package-manifest workflow entries are rediscovered in-process without requiring top-level `/reload` or restart ([#1155](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1155)).
- Fixed completed imported workflow boundary stages rendering as empty graph nodes by showing the child workflow name, child run id prefix, and selected output count in the node card.
- Fixed the bundled deep-research workflow line-count heuristic hanging Windows CI by replacing its POSIX `wc` subprocess with portable in-process line counting.
- Kept workflow stage model metadata as the raw model id while surfacing Codex fast mode as a separate visible `fast` marker on workflow node cards, including stages that use the default Atomic SDK adapter settings manager.
- Show workflow Codex fast-mode metadata on running workflow nodes as soon as the stage session starts, including explicit-model stages, catalog-resolved bare model aliases, and custom resource-loader stages whose settings manager is created by the Atomic SDK.
- Kept workflow Codex fast-mode markers synchronized across fallback attempts: running nodes now update when fallback switches to a fast-eligible model, completed nodes clear stale `fast` markers when fallback finishes on a non-eligible model, and prompt-adapter stages no longer create SDK sessions only to compute fast metadata.
- Made successful headless `/workflow` informational commands emit displayable command output instead of dropping success messages through the no-op non-interactive UI reporter, made degraded terminal-detail fallback rendering avoid fabricating successful status for unknown run states, and preserved non-interactive execution policy when resuming failed workflow runs ([#1123](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1123)).
- Suppressed workflow lifecycle steer notices while awaited non-interactive workflow dispatch is already waiting for terminal completion, and made workflow chat-surface custom-message content printable by default for headless list/status/detail/dispatch/killed output ([#1123](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1123)).
- Re-enabled deterministic non-interactive workflow execution: headless sessions keep the `workflow` tool, `/workflow <name> key=value` skips interactive pickers, named workflow dispatch waits for the terminal run snapshot, declared human-in-the-loop workflows are rejected, top-level `ctx.ui.*` is unavailable, and non-interactive stage sessions exclude `ask_user_question` without binding broker-backed extension UI ([#1123](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1123)).
- Added a concise display-only `User responded with: ...` workflow HiL answer notice so the main chat transcript records the answer for user-visible audit without triggering an autonomous model turn or adding the notice to LLM context ([#1137](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1137)).
- Suppressed workflow HiL answer interrupt notices for prompts answered by the main-chat `workflow` tool, so tool-driven answers do not dismiss the current main-chat turn with workflow-chat wording ([#1137](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1137)).
- Hardened workflow awaiting-input lifecycle notices and readiness-gate answers: awaiting-input lifecycle states now emit main-chat steer notices for dedupe-aware model visibility while preserving the existing `/workflow connect` and `workflow send` response hints, readiness gates use unique prompt ids per gate instance, and duplicate/raced `workflow send` answers for a just-resolved brokered input request now report the request as already answered instead of falling through to `No matching pending prompt` ([#1137](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1137)).
- Prevented Enter used for `/workflow connect`, graph attach, direct stage attach, unrelated graph-node inspection, or transition key-repeat from immediately submitting workflow HIL prompts; prompt submission now requires the user to be past the attach transition and press Enter while the specific prompted node is attached, leaving sibling HIL prompts pending ([#1148](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1148)).
- Fixed completed human-in-the-loop prompt archives so reattached read-only prompt nodes keep their prompt card scrollable with keyboard and mouse-wheel input ([#1140](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1140)).
- Kept the workflow graph overlay navigable while a stage-local human-input prompt is awaiting a response: graph navigation, the stage switcher, Ctrl+D detach, and mouse-wheel scrolling now stay owned by graph mode until the user explicitly attaches to the prompted stage ([#1141](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1141)).
- Preserved literal slash text entry in legacy run-level workflow prompt cards, so paths and URLs such as `/tmp/file` remain typable while the prompt owns input ([#1141](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1141)).
- Cleared brokered stage HIL UI during terminal stage cleanup so a completed workflow does not leave an active `ask_user_question`/custom prompt card visible after detach ([#1141](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1141)).
- Fixed workflow HIL select/editor prompts so navigation, scroll input, and ambiguous Escape-prefix input cannot advance prompts before an explicit configured confirm/Enter submit or Ctrl+C skip. Graph-mode prompt cards now honor custom select keybindings, and Enter submitted during connect/attach/detach transitions is time-boxed so key repeat cannot attach or answer the next prompt accidentally ([#1148](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1148)).
- Preserved synthetic workflow HiL prompt nodes as `awaiting_input` when an unrelated main-chat `ask_user_question` result arrives, so choosing to leave a workflow prompt open no longer makes the orchestrator node look like it resumed while the prompt is still unanswered ([#1137](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1137)).
- Fixed headless `/workflow <name>` print-mode automation so successful non-interactive runs wait for terminal snapshots and emit printable run-detail summaries, while terminal failures surface as command-visible errors instead of silent zero-output successes ([#1156](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1156)).

## [0.8.21] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Promoted the 0.8.21 prerelease changes to a stable release.

## [0.8.21-0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Enabled the `/workflow send` action (with `delivery: "answer"`) to answer a stage's brokered structured prompts — an in-stage `ask_user_question` call or the deterministic readiness gate — without the interactive TUI/graph overlay. These prompts resolve through the `StageUiBroker` (`ctx.ui.custom`) rather than the simple `store.pendingPrompt` model, so `send` previously no-op'd ("No pending prompt to answer") and they could only be answered by attaching the graph viewer. The stage UI broker now carries an optional headless-answer adapter (`provideStagePrompt` / `peekStagePrompt` / `answerStagePrompt` / `clearStagePrompt`), keyed by `(runId, stageId)`, that maps a simple answer — a free-text reply, an option label, a 1-based option index, comma-separated labels for multi-select, or a pre-built `response` — into the `QuestionnaireResult` the tool expects. The executor's existing `ask_user_question` watcher captures the tool-call `args` to build the adapter, and the readiness gate registers one statically; both surface a serializable `inputRequest` descriptor on the stage snapshot (shown in `/workflow stage` / `stages` output) so an orchestrating agent can see the questions/options and answer them programmatically.
- Added a deterministic readiness gate after `ask_user_question` tool calls inside workflow stages. When a stage's model turn issues an `ask_user_question` call, the workflow re-uses the structured `ask_user_question` UI — rendered inline in the attached stage chat via the stage UI broker — to ask "Are you ready to move on to the next stage?" (Yes/No) before completing/advancing the stage. Answering **No** (or "Chat about this"/cancel) steers the stage with a continuation message so the conversation keeps going, then re-shows the gate after the next turn, repeating until **Yes**; **Yes** resumes normal sequential and dependent-parallel progression. Detection is independent of how the underlying UI is implemented, and the executor exposes a `confirmStageReadiness` seam so the gate is fully testable. `@bastani/atomic` now also exports `createAskUserQuestionToolDefinition` so first-party extensions can invoke the structured prompt deterministically ([#1099](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1099)).

### Fixed

- Fixed background workflow HIL prompt nodes becoming input-dead when they appeared while the orchestrator graph overlay was already open: the visible overlay now reclaims focus on awaiting-input store updates, and the graph auto-focuses newly awaiting prompt nodes so Enter attaches directly to the HIL response UI.
- Fixed the `/workflow status <id>` run-detail card still ticking (and flickering the whole screen) even after the chat-surface clock was frozen: a running stage's in-flight tool-activity label (e.g. `bash · 6s`) was computed inside `stageActivityString()` from a fresh `Date.now()`, bypassing the capture-once `now` that `renderRunDetail` threads everywhere else. While a background workflow ran, the below-editor companion widget drove a full re-render roughly once per second (and on every store mutation); each re-render advanced that label, and once the detail card had scrolled above the viewport fold pi-tui took the full-screen-clear path (CSI 2J + CSI H + CSI 3J), read as whole-page + chat-box flicker. `stageActivityString()` now uses the threaded `now`, so scrollback run-detail cards are byte-stable across re-renders (the companion widget still owns the live, ticking view).
- Fixed the `/workflow status` and `/workflow status <id>` chat-surface cards triggering a full-screen redraw (clear + scrollback wipe) every render tick once they scroll above the viewport fold. Their custom-message renderer's `render()` lambda re-runs on every TUI frame (pi-tui fans out to every child each `doRender`, and the live workflow/subagent widgets request a frame ~12×/sec while runs are active), and it called `renderStatusList` / `renderRunDetail` without a captured clock, so they fell through to `Date.now()` each frame and ticked the `elapsed` / `running` labels — and pi-tui full-clears the screen (CSI 2J + CSI H + CSI 3J) whenever a changed line sits above the fold, read as whole-screen flicker on terminals without synchronized output (e.g. mosh). The renderer now captures wall-clock once when the chat entry's component is created and threads it through to the status/detail renderers, so these point-in-time scrollback snapshots stay byte-stable across re-renders (the live widget still owns live state). Mirrors the earlier tool-result status-card fix.
- Fixed answering a stage's brokered structured prompt (an in-stage `ask_user_question` or the readiness gate) via `/workflow send` replying **"User declined to answer questions"** and leaving the stage stuck `running` with no pending input — even though a real answer was sent. A structured `response` was forwarded verbatim to the `ask_user_question` tool: a JSON-encoded string was captured as raw free text, and — most damagingly — any object with an `answers` array (e.g. the orchestrator-friendly `{ answers: [{ question, answer }] }`) was treated as a pre-built `QuestionnaireResult` despite lacking the numeric `questionIndex` the tool envelope requires, so it matched no question segment and declined. `coerceStageInputAnswer` now forwards `raw` ONLY for a fully-formed result (every answer carries a numeric `questionIndex`); every other shape — JSON strings, `answers[]`/`questions[]` entries, flat `{ answer | label | selected }`, string arrays — is normalized to a label/index/multi-select value that the stage prompt adapter resolves against the question's options (assigning the correct `questionIndex`). The readiness decision (`readinessResultMeansAdvance`) matches the advance option case/whitespace-insensitively and via `selected[]`. A new regression test drives the real `StageUiBroker` + `ask_user_question` tool resolution path (the seam the earlier unit tests missed) and reproduces the decline for the `answers[]`-without-`questionIndex` payload. The "keep exploring"/stay path is unchanged ([#1099](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1099)).
- Hardened the `/workflow` tool-result renderer against missing or unshaped payloads. `renderResult` is passed `result.details`, which can be absent during streaming/partial renders or on error paths, and previously dereferenced a missing `action` and crashed the TUI render loop. It now degrades gracefully (renders nothing for partials, a generic notice otherwise) ([#1099](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1099)).
- Made `terminate: true` tool results deterministic when deriving a stage/task's result text: when an agent turn ends on a terminating tool, the stage runner now returns that tool result's output instead of any prose the model emitted before the tool call. This fixes the `goal` and `ralph` review gates, whose terminating `review_decision` structured-output tool emits clean JSON — previously the preceding assistant narration was captured instead, so the strict `JSON.parse` failed and a valid verdict was misclassified as a reviewer failure ("returned invalid structured JSON"), blocking quorum and forcing extra turns ([#1099](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1099)).
- Tightened terminating-tool result detection when deriving a stage/task's result text. The stage runner now treats a trailing tool result as the deterministic turn output ONLY when that tool call actually returned `terminate: true` — tracked at runtime from the session's `tool_execution_end` events, since the tool-result message itself does not carry the flag — instead of whenever the last conversational message merely happened to be a tool result. A turn that ends on a non-terminating tool result (e.g. aborted or interrupted right after a tool call) now correctly falls back to the last assistant message, and that fallback no longer surfaces non-terminating tool output. Verified end-to-end against real `terminate: true`, `terminate: false`, and no-tool stages ([#1099](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1099)).
- Fixed a mid-turn `ask_user_question` (or readiness gate) rendering but being input-dead in the attached stage chat. After a readiness-gate "stay" returns to the composer and the user submits another message, the agent's next question mounts while host keyboard focus has drifted off the overlay; the focus re-assertion was suppressed during streaming (a blunt guard added to avoid a prior continuation stall), so arrows/Enter were ignored and nothing could be answered or sent to the model. The overlay's `requestFocus` is now idempotent — it grabs focus only when the overlay does not already own it (`isFocused()`), so the redundant `focus()` that stalled the stream never runs. The stage chat now requests focus whenever a custom UI is shown (including mid-turn) and the focus-hold timer keeps a mounted question focused, trusting `requestFocus` to no-op when unnecessary ([#1120](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1120)).
- Detaching or closing the attached stage chat (Ctrl+D / Ctrl+C) while a stage has a pending human-input request — an agent `ask_user_question` call or the readiness gate — no longer cancels that request. Previously, tearing down the chat view (or its stage UI broker host) rejected the pending prompt, so the stage silently dropped out of `awaiting_input` and the question disappeared. Detaching, closing, and disposing now only stop *displaying* the request: it stays pending (the stage remains `awaiting_input`) and is re-displayed when a host re-attaches. A pending request is settled only by the user answering (broker resolve) or the run aborting via its `AbortSignal` — the single chokepoints for ending a human-input request ([#1099](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1099)).

## [0.8.20] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Promoted the 0.8.20 prerelease changes to a stable release.

## [0.8.20-0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added main-chat lifecycle steer notices for workflow completion, failure, and awaiting-input pauses with global notification config controls ([#1085](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1085)).

### Fixed

- Fixed the background-workflow companion counter widget flickering every second while a run is active by updating a single long-lived above-editor widget in place instead of disposing and re-mounting a fresh widget factory on each elapsed-clock tick ([#1109](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1109)).
- Fixed workflow lifecycle completion/failure/awaiting-input notices crashing the TUI on narrow or freshly-resized terminals: the notice component now wraps to the render width (hard-breaking long run ids) instead of emitting a single fixed line, which pi-tui rejects with a hard "Rendered line exceeds terminal width" throw ([#1109](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1109)).
- Fixed the workflow companion counter widget triggering a full-screen redraw (clear + scrollback wipe) on every elapsed-clock tick after the terminal is resized while a run is active. The widget now mounts `belowEditor` instead of `aboveEditor`, keeping its live clock line within the bottom viewport; pi-tui full-clears the screen whenever a changed line sits above the viewport fold, and an above-editor widget was pushed above the fold once the editor/status region grew tall ([#1109](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1109)).
- Disabled workflows in non-interactive (`-p` / `--print` / `--mode json`) sessions, which bind a no-op UI surface and cannot drive workflow prompts, pickers, or the graph overlay: the `workflow` tool is removed from the model's active tool set at session start, and the `/workflow` command (reachable via `atomic -p "/workflow …"`) is refused — preventing headless runs from stalling on work that can never complete ([#1096](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1096)).
- Escaped workflow lifecycle notice text and structured response hints, isolated lifecycle send failures from store subscribers, and rejected empty lifecycle notification event lists ([#1085](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1085)).
- Fixed stage awaiting-input lifecycle notice dedupe so promptless pauses after resolved prompts are not suppressed by historical prompt metadata ([#1085](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1085)).
- Reset workflow lifecycle-notification dedupe state at chat session boundaries so reused workflow run IDs in later sessions still emit completion/failure/input notices ([#1085](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1085)).
- Warn before starting or resuming another session when workflows are still in flight, allowing users to cancel before those runs are killed and current-session workflow history is cleared ([#1082](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1082)).
- Prevented workflow stage sessions from exposing or executing the `workflow` tool while preserving stage-level subagent delegation.
- Retained completed, failed, and killed workflow runs in user-facing status/connect surfaces and changed workflow kill controls to mark runs killed without removing them from live inspection history ([#1083](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1083)).

## [0.8.18] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Promoted the 0.8.18 prerelease changes to a stable release.

## [0.8.18-0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added Ralph `git_worktree_dir` support for running stages from an optional Git worktree, reusing/sharing existing worktrees from the invoking repository as-is and leaving worktrees in place for retries.

### Changed

- Replaced regex-based workflow discovery stage validation with runtime empty-graph validation based on actual stage creation while keeping discovery side-effect-free.
- Threaded named workflow invocation cwd into workflow run contexts so workflow-owned artifacts can use the explicit runner cwd.
- Split worker project-initialization preflight guidance from Goal receipt/reporting instructions.

### Fixed

- Defaulted workflow `ctx.cwd` to the reusable worktree cwd when `worktreeFromInputs` resolves a `gitWorktreeDir`, so workflow-owned artifacts such as Ralph specs are written inside the worktree unless explicitly overridden.
- Avoided blank deep-research display paths when a displayed artifact path equals the workflow invocation directory.
- Distinguished Ralph same-repository worktree classification and canonicalization failures from definitely non-Git existing `git_worktree_dir` paths.
- Updated Ralph to revise a stable original spec file across planner iterations and clarified `git_worktree_dir` null-byte diagnostics.

## [0.8.17] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Promoted the 0.8.17 prerelease changes to a stable release.

## [0.8.17-0] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking Changes

- Removed Ralph's configurable `review_quorum` and `blocker_threshold` inputs; `max_turns` remains configurable while reviewer quorum and blocker threshold use fixed controller defaults ([#1061](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1061)).

### Changed

- Aligned Ralph's goal-continuation prompt more closely with Codex `/goal` hidden continuation guidance, including current-state evidence, non-shrinking scope, fidelity, completion audit, and strict blocked audit language ([#1061](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1061)).
- Restored Ralph's stronger historical review gate prompt and `review_decision` schema with findings, oracle satisfaction, receipt assessment, verification remaining, and reviewer-error guard fields.

## [0.8.16] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Promoted the 0.8.16 prerelease changes to a stable release.

## [0.8.16-0] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking Changes

- Removed Ralph's `prompt` and `max_loops` compatibility inputs; use the canonical `objective` and `max_turns` inputs instead ([#1061](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1061)).

### Changed

- Reworked Ralph into a Goal Runner workflow with a persisted goal ledger, bounded worker turns, parallel structured reviewers, reviewer-quorum completion, repeated-blocker gating, and final status reporting while excluding token-budget behavior ([#1061](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1061)).

### Fixed

- Hardened Ralph's goal-runner edge cases around base-branch sanitization coverage, worker/reviewer failure handling, cross-turn review context, bounded blocker-threshold handling, and unused ledger state ([#1061](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1061)).

## [0.8.15] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking Changes

- Changed workflow human-in-the-loop prompts (`ctx.ui.input`, `ctx.ui.confirm`, `ctx.ui.select`, and `ctx.ui.editor`) to render as synthetic graph stages with `awaiting_input` status; consumers should handle the new `StageSnapshot.promptAnswerState` metadata and avoid caching `StageSnapshot.parentIds` references across store updates ([#1046](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1046)).
- Changed `ctx.ui.select(..., [])` to throw `pi-workflows: ctx.ui.select requires at least one option` before creating a prompt node instead of returning an empty string ([#1046](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1046)).

### Added

- Added workflow tool stage introspection and control actions (`stages`, `stage`, `transcript`, `send`, `pause`, and `reload`) for inspecting stage state, reading transcripts, answering prompts, controlling live stages, pausing runs, and reloading workflow resources ([#1023](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1023)).
- Added live-memory prompt answer replay for workflow continuations using snapshot-safe `promptAnswerState` markers and a private `PromptAnswerRecord` ledger that is excluded from snapshots and persistence ([#1046](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1046)).

### Changed

- Updated Ralph around an autonomous goal contract so planner, implementation, and reviewer/auditor stages infer verifiable criteria, require receipts, and judge completion against the verification oracle instead of document completeness alone ([#1053](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1053)).
- Updated Ralph's orchestrator prompt to discover project initialization needs from repository evidence before implementation work proceeds ([#1048](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1048)).
- Added a final Ralph PR-preparation phase that reviews changes against the configured base branch, tries available GitHub credentials using local git identity as a hint, posts implementation notes as a PR comment, and creates a pull request when possible.
- Updated Ralph to persist planner goal contracts and implementation notes as OS-temp workflow artifacts, and pass file paths rather than full plan text to later stages ([#1037](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1037)).
- Updated `deep-research-codebase` output layout to write public reports under `research/` and hidden per-run handoff artifacts under `research/.deep-research-<run-id>/`.

### Fixed

- Returned the workflow overlay to the graph orchestrator after answering or skipping a `ctx.ui` prompt node, and preserved the prompt's question footprint for read-only prompt-node views.
- Removed biasing stage-output and iteration-count context from Ralph reviewer prompts while making the comparison base branch explicit ([#1037](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1037)).
- Ordered snapshot transcript fallback entries chronologically before applying `tail`/`limit`, preserving terminal result/error entries after tools for missing or tied timestamps ([#1023](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1023)).
- Reloaded workflow resources directly for `workflow({ action: "reload" })` instead of queuing a literal `/workflow reload` follow-up ([#1023](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1023)).
- Kept pending prompts unresolved when `workflow({ action: "send" })` omits `text`, `response`, and `message`, while preserving explicit empty-string answers ([#1023](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1023)).
- Included `deep-research-codebase` discovery-stage handoff files in the persisted run manifest.
- Persisted `deep-research-codebase` final reports as dated Markdown research docs while retaining file-only handoffs for bounded aggregation.
- Prevented `deep-research-codebase` aggregation from inlining large specialist transcripts by using file-only handoff artifacts ([#1016](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1016)).
- Removed model metadata from workflow node cards while retaining fallback dependency metadata ([#1011](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/1011)).
- Preserve the selected workflow switcher row highlight through truncation ellipses on long stage names.
