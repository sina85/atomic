/**
 * Shared state store for inline workflow input forms.
 *
 * One entry per active or historical form, keyed by `formId` (uuid).
 * The custom message renderer (chat-history card) and the custom editor
 * (bottom-of-screen input) both read/write through this module so a single
 * keystroke updates both views via `tui.requestRender()`.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   `createForm(id, …)`          → status = "editing"
 *   editor mutates fields        → status stays "editing"
 *   `finalizeForm(id, "submit")` → status = "submitted", values frozen
 *   `finalizeForm(id, "cancel")` → status = "cancelled"
 *
 * After finalize the state stays in the map forever (module-lifetime). The
 * renderer reads it to display the historical card. If the process restarts,
 * the map is empty and the renderer falls back to a "form (snapshot lost)"
 * placeholder — acceptable because frozen cards are decorative, not
 * functional.
 *
 * Why a global registry instead of closure capture: the message renderer is
 * registered ONCE at factory time and called many times for any number of
 * future messages. It can't close over per-invocation state. The formId in
 * `message.details` is the only stable link between a chat-history entry and
 * its mutable backing record.
