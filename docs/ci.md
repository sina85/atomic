# CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows for the Atomic monorepo and the publishable npm packages, `@bastani/atomic` and `@bastani/atomic-natives`.

`@bastani/atomic` lives in `packages/coding-agent`. It is the Atomic-branded coding-agent CLI package and bundles the first-party workflows, subagents, MCP, web-access, intercom, cursor, and native-loader assets into its published tarball.

`@bastani/atomic-natives` lives in `packages/natives`. It is published alongside `@bastani/atomic` so the CLI can depend on a provenance-backed root native package plus generated optional platform packages. Other companion packages under `packages/*` remain private and are copied into `@bastani/atomic` at build time.

```

## Package Shape

The repository root is a private workspace package named `atomic-monorepo`.

The publishable workspace packages are:

- `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
  - package name: `@bastani/atomic`
  - CLI binary: `atomic` → `dist/cli.js`
  - `main`: `./dist/index.js`
  - `types`: `./dist/index.d.ts`
  - package version: shared by all `packages/*` packages
- `packages/natives/package.json`
  - package name: `@bastani/atomic-natives`
  - NAPI-RS loader and generated optional platform packages for Atomic native bindings
  - package version: shared with `@bastani/atomic`

Bundled builtin packages copied into `packages/coding-agent/dist/builtin/` during `bun run build`:

- `workflows` from `packages/workflows` (`@bastani/workflows`)
- `subagents` from `packages/subagents` (`@bastani/subagents`)
- `mcp` from `packages/mcp` (`@bastani/mcp`)
- `web-access` from `packages/web-access` (`@bastani/web-access`)
- `intercom` from `packages/intercom` (`@bastani/intercom`)

These companion packages remain in the workspace for source organization and tests, but are marked `private: true` and must not be published independently. `@bastani/atomic-natives` is the exception because `@bastani/atomic` depends on it at runtime.


## CI performance and caching

Recent Actions measurements (2026-07-12) showed the Linux test leg completing in about 3m34s while Windows took about 6m02s on a main push and 7m58s on a PR. The platform-independent Windows work removed here is typecheck (15s), file-length/docs links (about 2s), and Mintlify (61s), for about **1m18s** of sampled critical-path savings. Platform-sensitive unit, integration, native-package, coding-agent, and archive smoke coverage remains on Windows. Binary assembly also reuses the install and package build already completed in each job, avoiding another frozen install and package build.

Release tags no longer repeat typecheck and the complete test suites. Creating a tag starts `publish-tag-created.yml` through GitHub's native `create` event. A `create` run can evaluate YAML from the created tag, so the listener is untrusted and is **not** the publication security boundary. The checked-in listener is deliberately inert (`permissions: {}`, no checkout, repository code, artifacts, secrets, OIDC, or publish commands); its only useful output is a completed-run signal. `publish-release.yml` is selected separately through `workflow_run`, which GitHub loads from the default branch. The protected integrity job requires the exact `publish-release.yml@refs/heads/<default>` workflow ref, checks out its immutable `github.workflow_sha`, and proves that SHA remains in freshly fetched protected-default history. Normal publication accepts only the pinned upstream repository numeric ID/full name and a successful completed `create` run from the exact `Publish tag created` workflow numeric ID/path. It validates the source and head repository identities, workflow ID/path, event, status, conclusion, run ID/attempt, tag, and SHA before release processing; arbitrary workflows and `Publish release` itself cannot satisfy those checks, so the design does not recurse. The publisher independently resolves the exact remote tag and validates the release-base trailers and deterministic tree.

Every same-run artifact download has a bounded transport-flake recovery state machine: clean the destination, attempt once, remove any partial download on failure, retry exactly once, remove any second partial download, and then fail with an explicit message. There is no polling, sleep, or third attempt. The verified-source consumers still validate the protected job's SHA-256 digest before extraction. Extraction streams the archive to tar over stdin (`tar -xzf - ... < "$archive"`), which is portable across GNU tar and bsdtar and prevents Git Bash GNU tar from interpreting an absolute Windows `C:` archive operand as a remote host. A failed extraction removes its partial destination.

The `workflow_run` security boundary never checks out or executes the tag tree. The top-level verifier comes from protected main. Its deterministic reconstruction executes the version/shrinkwrap scripts from the release commit's sole parent only after proving that parent remains an ancestor of the freshly fetched, exact allowlisted release base; repository policy requires every configured base to be protected with required CI. Thus an arbitrary tag cannot select executable verifier code. After the context, ancestry, base, and deterministic-tree checks pass, the trusted job exports the verified tree with `git archive`, records its SHA-256 digest as a job output, and uploads it as an immutable same-run source artifact. Every smoke, native-build, and preparation job downloads that exact SHA-named artifact into a freshly cleaned temporary path, applies the bounded retry above, verifies the protected job output digest, and extracts it into a fresh temporary directory before running any repository command. Documentation validation remains read-only in intent, but the preparation job still discards its working tree afterward and restores the archive only after rechecking its protected digest; dependency installation and artifact production therefore start from fresh verified bytes. Those jobs have no tag checkout and configure no Actions, Bun, `node_modules`, or Cargo cache. This implements GitHub CodeQL's guidance to [avoid caching in sensitive release workflows](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/actions/actions-cache-poisoning-poisonable-step/): unverified tag-controlled code never receives the default-branch cache service credentials and cannot write cache state or substitute a build input.

Verification/build/package jobs remain read-only. During preparation, NAPI-RS generates the six platform packages and updates the root `@bastani/atomic-natives` manifest with all six exact-version `optionalDependencies` while `--skip-optional-publish` prevents that preparation command from contacting the registry; the workflow then packs and inspects the actual root tarball manifest. A checksummed artifact then crosses into a minimal npm job with `id-token: write` but no repository-write permission. That job independently requires the exact eight-name/version package set and compares `release.env` byte-for-byte with trusted job outputs; it never sources, evaluates, or executes artifact metadata. It performs no checkout, install, docs validation, or build and reconfirms the tag before each allowlisted tarball publication. A final separate job has `contents: write` but no OIDC permission and only verifies the artifact/tag before creating the GitHub Release. npm publication remains tokenless `npm publish --provenance` using OIDC.

Blacksmith's [Actions cache](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-actions) automatically redirects official GitHub and popular third-party cache actions to its colocated backend, but it does not implicitly add a Bun dependency cache or Cargo compilation cache. We intentionally do not cache `node_modules`, Bun's global cache, or Cargo outputs. In the protected publisher this is a security invariant, not only a performance choice: no job that executes the verified release source restores or writes a cache. [Sticky Disks](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-sticky-disks) and [Git checkout caching](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/git-checkout-caching) must not be enabled for the publisher's release-source jobs; their source input is exclusively the checksummed artifact described above.

The test matrix checks out with `lfs: true` (two coding-agent test fixtures are LFS objects) and `fetch-depth: 0`. Full history plus tags is load-bearing, not an optimization target: the `test:ci-contracts` step executes `scripts/verify-release-integrity.ts` against a real historical release tag, including a `merge-base --is-ancestor` check against `origin/main` that a shallow clone cannot answer (a shallow-fetch attempt broke this contract on both platforms). The check itself costs single-digit seconds and is the only pre-merge guard on the release verifier, so it stays. With [Git checkout caching](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/git-checkout-caching) the full clone lives on the runner-side mirror and full-history checkouts stay cheap; only the standard-clone fallback pays for history. A `Blacksmith cache setup failed, using standard checkout: ... failed to expose and mount sticky disk` warning is the beta git-mirror feature degrading gracefully on Blacksmith's side — the run continues on a normal clone; it is not caused by (or fixable from) workflow YAML, and recurring instances belong in a Blacksmith support report.

Blacksmith [Test Analytics](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/test-analytics) requires uploaded JUnit XML. Bun's current test commands do not produce a repository-standard JUnit artifact, so CI does not add a lossy conversion solely for analytics. The Blacksmith dashboard/run history should continue to be used to validate these savings and identify a future test shard only when suite timings justify it. Runner sizes remain at 4 vCPU for test/smoke work; the measured work is mostly serial, so a larger runner is not assumed to improve it.

### Bounded flaky-test recovery

Only the unit, integration, and coding-agent test-suite steps use `scripts/run-flaky-test-suite.ts`. The green path runs the command once with no artifact writes. After a genuine suite failure, the runner preserves attempt 1, emits an OS/Bun/CPU/memory/load summary, and reruns that same smallest safe suite **once**. If attempt 2 passes, the job succeeds with a visible `Detected flake` warning and step-summary entry; if it fails, the step fails with both logs. `.ci-diagnostics/` is uploaded for 14 days on both Linux and Windows whenever files exist.

This is not a blanket command retry. Typecheck, docs, file-length/lint, builds, native/package/archive checks, shrinkwrap, metadata, provenance, and publishing never use the wrapper. Workflow structure and release-verifier fixtures run first in the separate `test:ci-contracts` step with no retry wrapper; the retry runner's own unit contract is also a no-retry file. Bun does not currently expose a stable cross-platform failed-file manifest suitable for safely reconstructing arbitrary test commands, so the fallback reruns the named suite rather than guessing file paths. The policy adds no second-run cost when CI is green; a recovered flake costs one suite duration and remains observable instead of hiding the instability.

### Job time limits

Every job in `test.yml`, `publish-tag-created.yml`, and `publish-release.yml` sets an explicit `timeout-minutes` so a hung process cannot consume GitHub's 360-minute default. Release integrity, preparation, npm publication, and GitHub Release jobs use 10 minutes. Windows smoke and native builds retain 15 minutes because their measured cold builds legitimately exceed the shorter budget; the artifact retry remains bounded inside those job-level limits.

## Pull Request Workflows

### Tests (`test.yml`)

Runs on pushes to `main`, `release/**`, and `prerelease/**`, plus PRs targeting any branch so allowlisted workstream bases receive the same required validation before merge.

Matrix:

- `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` with native `linux-x64` binary smoke coverage
- `blacksmith-4vcpu-windows-2025` with native `windows-x64` binary smoke coverage

Steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Set up Bun.
3. Set up Node 24 (required by the installed-package Node smoke below; the published `atomic` bin runs under `#!/usr/bin/env node` for npm/bun installs).
4. Install dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
5. On Linux, run typecheck, file-length, and docs/Mintlify checks. Unit, native-package, and coding-agent suites continue on both Linux and Windows.
6. Build `@bastani/atomic` and run `bun run test:integration` with `ATOMIC_REQUIRE_INSTALLED_NODE_SMOKE=1` on both platforms. The installed-like layout runs `dist/cli.js --no-session` under **Node**, failing on extension-load diagnostics and preserving the cross-platform npm-install behavior.
7. Build the native release binary with `scripts/build-binaries.sh --skip-install --skip-package-build --platform <native-x64>` so the matrix does not repeat its install or package build.
8. Extract the generated archive, verify required bundled paths, run `atomic --version`, and run `atomic --no-session` far enough to catch extension-load diagnostics while allowing the expected no-models exit.

## Release Pipeline

### Trigger and privilege boundary

Creating a valid release tag starts the tag-sourced `publish-tag-created.yml` listener. Its checked-in definition rejects branch creates and invalid version tags, but its YAML is untrusted because `create` can select the created ref. The listener's minimal shape limits blast radius; it is not authority to publish. A completed listener run triggers `publish-release.yml` through `workflow_run`. GitHub requires that downstream workflow to exist on the default branch and runs it in the default-branch context.

Before touching release content, `publish-release.yml` validates the upstream and head repository full names and immutable numeric IDs, event action, exact source workflow numeric ID/path, source event/status/conclusion, positive run ID/attempt, tag, and full SHA. It also requires its own `github.workflow_ref` to be protected-main `publish-release.yml`, pins `github.workflow_sha`, and proves that SHA is contained in freshly fetched protected-default history. It independently resolves `refs/tags/<tag>` and requires equality with the source SHA. The source selector names only `Publish tag created`; because the protected workflow is distinctly named `Publish release`, it cannot select itself.

The npm job uses the protected-branch `npm-publish` environment and only receives `contents: read` plus `id-token: write`. Configure the package-specific npm trusted publisher for **all eight published package names** to workflow filename `publish-release.yml` and environment `npm-publish`: `@bastani/atomic`, `@bastani/atomic-natives`, `@bastani/atomic-natives-darwin-arm64`, `@bastani/atomic-natives-darwin-x64`, `@bastani/atomic-natives-linux-arm64-gnu`, `@bastani/atomic-natives-linux-x64-gnu`, `@bastani/atomic-natives-win32-arm64-msvc`, and `@bastani/atomic-natives-win32-x64-msvc`. npm permits one trusted publisher per package. No `NPM_TOKEN` or `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` is used. The separate GitHub Release job receives `contents: write` without `id-token: write`.

### Tag Naming

| Tag                                                       | npm tag  | GitHub Release                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (e.g. `0.8.0`)                  | `latest` | normal release, marked latest |
| `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<prerelease>` (e.g. `0.8.0-alpha.1`) | `next`   | prerelease, not marked latest |

`main` and every supported release workstream are **versionless**: their `packages/*/package.json` files stay at the `0.0.0` placeholder. The real version exists only in the tagged `Release <version>` tree produced by `scripts/cut-release.ts`, where the tag matches `packages/coding-agent/package.json` exactly and all workspace versions are stamped in sync. `publish-release.yml` verifies that tree as Git data, archives it without executing tag-controlled code, and runs read-only builds only after consumers verify the protected integrity job's source checksum; the credentialed jobs consume only separately checksummed prepared artifacts.

### Cutting a release (versionless base)

The selected base never carries a real version, so releasing does not bump it. Instead, `scripts/cut-release.ts` materializes the version on a throwaway `Release <version>` commit whose sole parent is the exact selected remote branch SHA, then tags that commit:

```sh
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.0 --base main --push
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.0-alpha.1 --base main --push
```

Internally the script validates a clean tree and a short canonical branch name supplied through `--base` (or uses the current attached branch when omitted). It canonicalizes that name to `refs/heads/<base>`, resolves exactly that ref on `origin`, creates a detached `git worktree` at the resulting full SHA, stamps every versioned manifest with `scripts/bump-version.ts` (all `packages/*/package.json`, the `@bastani/atomic-natives` pin, `packages/natives/native/index.js`, and the Cargo manifests/lock), and regenerates `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`. The release commit records `Release-base-ref: refs/heads/<base>` and `Release-base-sha: <full SHA>` trailers before it is tagged. The script removes the worktree and pushes only the tag; the selected base is never advanced by the version stamp. The publisher has no legacy fallback and rejects any release commit missing either trailer. `bun.lock` keeps the base's `0.0.0` workspace placeholders—it is not shipped in the npm tarball and `bun install --frozen-lockfile` tolerates the version-string mismatch.

The release shrinkwrap is prepared before the tag is published. Internal Atomic entries such as `@bastani/atomic-natives` and its generated platform optional packages are derived from the stamped local `package.json` metadata and deterministic npm tarball URLs like `https://registry.npmjs.org/@bastani/atomic-natives/-/atomic-natives-<version>.tgz`; the generator intentionally does not query npm metadata for the just-published native packages or require their registry `integrity` fields.

### Release base allowlist

`refs/heads/main` is always publication-eligible. To publish from another workstream, first protect that branch with the repository's required CI checks, then configure the repository variable `RELEASE_BASE_REFS`. Its value is a comma-separated list of exact canonical full refs, for example `refs/heads/release/workstream-a,refs/heads/prerelease/workstream-b`. Do not include spaces, globs, prefixes, short names such as `release/workstream-a`, remote aliases such as `origin/release/workstream-a`, or tags. Matching is exact and case-sensitive; malformed configured entries and refs absent from the allowlist fail closed. Adding a ref to this variable is the repository administrator's explicit attestation that the branch is an approved, protected release workstream; the publisher verifies commit/ref evidence but does not infer branch policy from its name.

The `publish-release` workflow's existing `base_ref` input remains a short branch name and defaults to `main`. It targets and synchronizes that branch, then invokes `cut-release.ts --base <base_ref>`. For a non-main value, the corresponding canonical `refs/heads/<base_ref>` must already be present in `RELEASE_BASE_REFS`.

### Why npm Publish Before GitHub Release?

npm versions are immutable. The workflow publishes to npm first so the GitHub Release is only created after the npm package is available.

npm provenance currently supports GitHub-hosted runners only, so the final publish job runs on `ubuntu-latest` even though the binary smoke-test and most native-artifact jobs can use Blacksmith runners. The native-artifact matrix follows Blacksmith's architecture-aware runner pattern: Linux x64 uses `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`, Linux arm64 uses `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404-arm`, Darwin arm64 uses `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, and Darwin x64 uses GitHub's Intel macOS runner (`macos-26-intel`) because Blacksmith does not provide Intel macOS runners.

### GitHub Release Creation

GitHub Releases are created with `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`, matching pi's release-action pattern. Release notes are extracted from `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` using a pi-style awk filter on the `## [<version>]` heading.

For prerelease versions (any version containing `-`):

- `prerelease: true`
- `make_latest: false`
- npm tag: `next`

For stable versions:

- `prerelease: false`
- `make_latest: true`
- npm tag: `latest`

Binaries attached to every release:

- `atomic-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-darwin-x64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-windows-x64.zip`
- `atomic-windows-arm64.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS`

---

## Publish Package Rule

CI publishes exactly eight allowlisted npm packages per release: the two package roots plus six generated native platform packages.

- `@bastani/atomic`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives-darwin-arm64`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives-darwin-x64`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives-linux-arm64-gnu`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives-linux-x64-gnu`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives-win32-arm64-msvc`
- `@bastani/atomic-natives-win32-x64-msvc`
Do not add publish steps for:

- `@bastani/workflows`
- `@bastani/subagents`
- `@bastani/mcp`
- `@bastani/web-access`
- `@bastani/intercom`
- `@bastani/cursor`
- any other `packages/*` workspace

Those extensions are bundled into `@bastani/atomic` by `packages/coding-agent/scripts/copy-builtin-packages.ts`.

---

## No Verdaccio Validation

Verdaccio is intentionally not used.

The meaningful pre-publish checks are split between required PR/base validation and release-specific gates. The release job proves the recorded base SHA is the release commit's sole parent, that this SHA remains contained in the freshly fetched current allowlisted remote branch, and that the release tree is exactly the deterministic release transform. It then checks:

- deterministic `npm-shrinkwrap.json` validation for `@bastani/atomic`
- synchronized tag/package versions and publish metadata
- `@bastani/atomic` build output and builtin extension/resources
- the packed `@bastani/atomic-natives` manifest's exact six platform `optionalDependencies`, each matching the release version
- exactly eight checksummed allowlisted npm tarballs and six release archives
- registry-integrity equality on idempotent skips and npm OIDC provenance on new publications

## Release Checklist

1. Choose the short release base name (default `main`). Move the `[Unreleased]` section in `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` to `## [0.8.0] - <YYYY-MM-DD>` and land it on that base like any normal change. The publish workflow uses this section as the GitHub Release body. **Do not bump any `package.json` version—the release base is versionless.** For a non-main base, configure its exact canonical ref in `RELEASE_BASE_REFS` before cutting the release.

2. Run local validation (optional; required PR/base CI already covers it on the integrated parent):

    ```sh
    bun run typecheck
    bun run check:file-length
    cd packages/coding-agent && bun run docs:check
    cd docs && bunx --bun mintlify@latest validate
    bunx --bun mintlify@latest broken-links
    cd ..
    bun run build
    cd ../..
    bun run test:unit
    bun run test:integration
    ./scripts/build-binaries.sh --platform linux-x64
    tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
    tar -xzf packages/coding-agent/binaries/atomic-linux-x64.tar.gz -C "$tmpdir"
    "$tmpdir/atomic/atomic" --version
    set +e
    output=$(printf '' | "$tmpdir/atomic/atomic" --no-session 2>&1)
    status=$?
    set -e
    echo "$output"
    if grep -q 'Failed to load extension' <<<"$output"; then
      exit 1
    fi
    if [ "$status" -ne 0 ] && ! grep -Eq 'No models available|No model selected|No API key found' <<<"$output"; then
      exit "$status"
    fi
    rm -rf "$tmpdir"

    On Windows, substitute `--platform windows-x64`, extract `atomic-windows-x64.zip`, and run `atomic.exe --version` plus the equivalent `atomic.exe --no-session` smoke. (A versionless base build reports the `0.0.0` placeholder for `--version`; a release build from the tag reports the real version.)

3. From a clean selected base, cut and push the release tag. This stamps the version onto a detached `Release 0.8.0` commit at the exact remote base SHA, regenerates the deterministic `@bastani/atomic` shrinkwrap from local metadata, records immutable base metadata, tags it, and pushes only the tag. Tag creation starts the inert signal; its successful completion starts the protected-main publisher through `workflow_run`.

    ```sh
    bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.0 --base main --push
    ```

    Omit `--push` to inspect the tag locally first (`git show 0.8.0`, `git log --oneline -1 0.8.0`), then `git push origin 0.8.0`. The selected base is never advanced by the version stamp.

    For a non-main workstream, substitute its short branch name for `main` and first add its exact canonical `refs/heads/<base>` value to `RELEASE_BASE_REFS`. Before pushing, inspect `git show -s --format=%B <version>` and require exactly one matching `Release-base-ref` and `Release-base-sha`; the latter must be the release commit's sole parent. The protected publisher rechecks both values against the current remote branch.

4. Inspect the resulting `Publish tag signal 0.8.0` and `Publish 0.8.0` runs. Do not dispatch a workflow, use `--watch`, or add sleep/poll loops. The publisher must be a `workflow_run` run linked to the exact successful signal run/tag/SHA. If a run is still active, return later or rely on GitHub notifications.

For prereleases, substitute `0.8.0-alpha.1`. The repository-local `publish-release` Atomic workflow uses the same signal-to-publisher path and returns a resumable blocked result when PR checks or publishing are still pending; it never waits, sleeps, polls, or dispatches another workflow.
