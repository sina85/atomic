# CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows for the Atomic monorepo and the single publishable npm package, `@bastani/atomic`.

`@bastani/atomic` lives in `packages/coding-agent`. It is the Atomic-branded coding-agent CLI package and bundles the first-party workflows, subagents, MCP, web-access, and intercom packages into its published tarball under `dist/builtin/`.

No other workspace package is published. The companion packages under `packages/*` remain private and are copied into `@bastani/atomic` at build time.

## Workflow Overview

  ├─ bun install --frozen-lockfile
  ├─ bun run typecheck
  ├─ cd packages/coding-agent && bun run build
  ├─ bun run test:unit
  ├─ bun run test:integration
  └─ scripts/build-binaries.sh --platform <native-x64> + atomic --version smoke test

  ├─ smoke test Linux x64 release archive in a dedicated job
  ├─ smoke test Windows x64 release archive in a dedicated job
  └─ publish after both smoke jobs pass
     ├─ resolve and validate the release tag
     ├─ bun install --frozen-lockfile
     ├─ bun run typecheck && bun run test:all
     ├─ validate package metadata, synced versions, and private bundled packages
     ├─ scripts/build-binaries.sh (regular build + cross-compile 6 targets)
     ├─ validate dist/builtin contains all bundled extensions
     ├─ extract release notes from packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md
     ├─ check whether the npm version already exists
     ├─ bun pm pack --dry-run from packages/coding-agent when publishing
     ├─ npm publish --provenance --tag "$NPM_TAG" from packages/coding-agent when needed
     ├─ determine GitHub Release type
     └─ create GitHub Release with binaries attached
```

## Package Shape

The repository root is a private workspace package named `atomic-monorepo`.

The only publishable workspace package is `packages/coding-agent/package.json`:

- package name: `@bastani/atomic`
- CLI binary: `atomic` → `dist/cli.js`
- `main`: `./dist/index.js`
- `types`: `./dist/index.d.ts`
- package version: shared by all `packages/*` packages

Bundled builtin packages copied into `packages/coding-agent/dist/builtin/` during `bun run build`:

- `workflows` from `packages/workflows` (`@bastani/workflows`)
- `subagents` from `packages/subagents` (`@bastani/subagents`)
- `mcp` from `packages/mcp` (`@bastani/mcp`)
- `web-access` from `packages/web-access` (`@bastani/web-access`)
- `intercom` from `packages/intercom` (`@bastani/intercom`)

These companion packages remain in the workspace for source organization and tests, but are marked `private: true` and must not be published independently.

## Pull Request Workflows

### Tests (`test.yml`)

Runs on pushes to `main` and PRs targeting `main`.

Matrix:

- `ubuntu-latest` with native `linux-x64` binary smoke coverage
- `windows-latest` with native `windows-x64` binary smoke coverage

Steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Set up Bun.
3. Install dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
4. Run `bun run typecheck`.
5. Build `@bastani/atomic` with `cd packages/coding-agent && bun run build`.
6. Run `bun run test:unit`.
7. Run `bun run test:integration`.
8. Build the native release binary with `scripts/build-binaries.sh --platform <native-x64>`.
9. Extract the generated release archive and run `atomic --version` from the extracted binary. The PR/push smoke tests do not run the longer `--no-session` runtime smoke; that coverage is reserved for the release smoke jobs.

### Code Review (`code-review.yml`)

Runs Claude-powered automated code review when pull requests are opened or synchronized.

### PR Description (`pr-description.yml`)

Generates or updates pull request descriptions when pull requests are opened or synchronized, except for Dependabot-authored pull requests.

### Claude Interactive (`claude.yml`)

Responds to `@claude` mentions in issue comments, pull request review comments, submitted pull request reviews, and newly opened or assigned issues.

## Release Pipeline

### Trigger

The publish pipeline (`publish.yml`) runs when:

- a `v<version>` tag is pushed (matches pi's `build-binaries.yml` trigger)
- `workflow_dispatch` is run with an explicit tag input such as `v0.8.0`

### Tag Naming

| Tag | npm tag | GitHub Release |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (e.g. `v0.8.0`) | `latest` | normal release, marked latest |
| `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<prerelease>` (e.g. `v0.8.0-0`) | `next` | prerelease, not marked latest |

The tag must match `packages/coding-agent/package.json` after removing the leading `v`. All `packages/*` package versions stay in sync via `scripts/bump-version.ts`.

### Version Bump

Use the top-level script:

```sh
bun run scripts/bump-version.ts 0.8.0
bun run scripts/bump-version.ts 0.8.0-0
bun install
```

The script updates every `packages/*/package.json` version and any package README version badge. Run `bun install` afterward so `bun.lock` records the same workspace versions.

### Publish Flow

Create GitHub Release with softprops/action-gh-release@v3
  · body: extracted CHANGELOG section
  · files: 6 binary archives
```

### Why npm Publish Before GitHub Release?

npm versions are immutable. The workflow publishes to npm first so the GitHub Release is only created after the npm package is available.

### GitHub Release Creation

GitHub Releases are created with `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`, matching pi's release-action pattern. Release notes are extracted from `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` using a pi-style awk filter on the `## [<version>]` heading.

For prerelease versions (any version containing `-`):

- `prerelease: true`
- `make_latest: false`
- npm tag: `next`

For stable versions:

- `prerelease: false`
- `make_latest: true`
- npm tag: `latest`

Binaries attached to every release:

- `atomic-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-darwin-x64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-windows-x64.zip`
- `atomic-windows-arm64.zip`

---

## Single-Package Publish Rule

CI must publish exactly one npm package: `@bastani/atomic` from `packages/coding-agent`.

Do not add publish steps for:

- `@bastani/workflows`
- `@bastani/subagents`
- `@bastani/mcp`
- `@bastani/web-access`
- `@bastani/intercom`
- any other `packages/*` workspace

Those extensions are bundled into `@bastani/atomic` by `packages/coding-agent/scripts/copy-builtin-packages.ts`.

---

## No Verdaccio Validation

Verdaccio is intentionally not used.

The meaningful pre-publish checks are:

- TypeScript typechecking
- unit and integration tests
- `@bastani/atomic` build output validation
- builtin extension/resource validation under `dist/builtin/`
- `bun pm pack --dry-run` from `packages/coding-agent`

---

## Workflow Files Reference

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `test.yml` | Push to `main`, PR to `main` | Install, typecheck, build `@bastani/atomic`, unit/integration tests, build native Linux/Windows binaries, and run `atomic --version` archive smoke tests |
| `publish.yml` | `v*` tag push, manual dispatch with tag input | Smoke test Linux/Windows binaries in parallel, build binaries, publish `@bastani/atomic` to npm with OIDC provenance, create GitHub Release with binaries |
| `code-review.yml` | PR opened/synchronized | Claude-powered code review |
| `pr-description.yml` | PR opened/synchronized | Claude-powered PR description generation, skipped for Dependabot |
| `claude.yml` | Issue/PR comments, issues, PR reviews | Interactive Claude assistant gated on `@claude` mentions |

---

## Release Checklist

1. Bump versions on `main` (or a short-lived PR branch):

   ```sh
   bun run scripts/bump-version.ts 0.8.0
   bun install
   ```

2. Move the `[Unreleased]` section in `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` to `## [0.8.0] - <YYYY-MM-DD>`. The publish workflow uses this section as the GitHub Release body.

3. Run local validation:

   ```sh
   bun run typecheck
   cd packages/coding-agent && bun run build
   cd ../..
   bun run test:unit
   bun run test:integration
   ./scripts/build-binaries.sh --platform linux-x64
   tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
   tar -xzf packages/coding-agent/binaries/atomic-linux-x64.tar.gz -C "$tmpdir"
   "$tmpdir/atomic/atomic" --version
   rm -rf "$tmpdir"
   ```

   On Windows, substitute `--platform windows-x64`, extract `atomic-windows-x64.zip`, and run `atomic.exe --version`.

4. Commit and tag:

   ```sh
   git add packages/*/package.json packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md bun.lock
   git add packages/*/README.md # only if the version bump script changed README badges
   git commit -m "chore(release): bump to v0.8.0"
   git tag v0.8.0
   git push origin main
   git push origin v0.8.0
   ```

5. Confirm `publish.yml` cross-compiles binaries, publishes `@bastani/atomic` to npm with OIDC provenance, and creates the GitHub Release with binaries attached.

For prereleases, substitute `0.8.0-0` and tag `v0.8.0-0`.
