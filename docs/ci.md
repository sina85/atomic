# CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows for the Atomic monorepo and the publishable npm packages, `@bastani/atomic` and `@bastani/atomic-natives`.

`@bastani/atomic` lives in `packages/coding-agent`. It is the Atomic-branded coding-agent CLI package and bundles the first-party workflows, subagents, MCP, web-access, intercom, cursor, and native-loader assets into its published tarball.

`@bastani/atomic-natives` lives in `packages/natives`. It is published alongside `@bastani/atomic` so the CLI can depend on a provenance-backed root native package plus generated optional platform packages. Other companion packages under `packages/*` remain private and are copied into `@bastani/atomic` at build time.

## Workflow Overview

```text
Pull request / push
  ├─ Linux: install, typecheck, file-length/docs checks, unit tests, native build, and coding-agent tests
  ├─ Linux + Windows: build @bastani/atomic and run the installed-package Node integration smoke
  └─ Linux + Windows: scripts/build-binaries.sh --skip-install --skip-package-build --platform <native-x64>
     └─ reuse the caller's install/build, extract the archive, verify bundled paths,
        and run --version plus --no-session smoke tests

```

## Package Shape

The repository root is a private workspace package named `atomic-monorepo`.

The publishable workspace packages are:

- `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
  - package name: `@bastani/atomic`
  - CLI binary: `atomic` → `dist/cli.js`
  - `main`: `./dist/index.js`
  - `types`: `./dist/index.d.ts`
  - package version: shared by all `packages/*` packages
- `packages/natives/package.json`
  - package name: `@bastani/atomic-natives`
  - NAPI-RS loader and generated optional platform packages for Atomic native bindings
  - package version: shared with `@bastani/atomic`

Bundled builtin packages copied into `packages/coding-agent/dist/builtin/` during `bun run build`:

- `workflows` from `packages/workflows` (`@bastani/workflows`)
- `subagents` from `packages/subagents` (`@bastani/subagents`)
- `mcp` from `packages/mcp` (`@bastani/mcp`)
- `web-access` from `packages/web-access` (`@bastani/web-access`)
- `intercom` from `packages/intercom` (`@bastani/intercom`)

These companion packages remain in the workspace for source organization and tests, but are marked `private: true` and must not be published independently. `@bastani/atomic-natives` is the exception because `@bastani/atomic` depends on it at runtime.


## CI performance and caching

Recent Actions measurements (2026-07-12) showed the Linux test leg completing in about 3m34s while Windows took about 6m02s on a main push and 7m58s on a PR. The platform-independent Windows work removed here is typecheck (15s), file-length/docs links (about 2s), and Mintlify (61s), for about **1m18s** of sampled critical-path savings. Platform-sensitive unit, integration, native-package, coding-agent, and archive smoke coverage remains on Windows. Binary assembly also reuses the install and package build already completed in each job, avoiding another frozen install and package build.

Release tags no longer repeat typecheck and the complete test suites. Creating a tag starts `publish.yml` through GitHub's native `create` event, which requires the workflow file to exist on the default branch. No tag-sourced signal workflow, workflow dispatch, history scan, sleep, or polling loop is involved. Repository-wide workflow permissions remain read-only; only the final npm/GitHub Release job receives `contents: write` and `id-token: write`. The protected integrity job requires `github.workflow_ref` to identify `publish.yml` on the protected default branch, checks out the pinned `github.workflow_sha`, and binds the event tag and triggering SHA to the current remote tag. It reads exactly one `Release-base-ref` and `Release-base-sha` from that immutable commit, requires a canonical and exactly allowlisted `refs/heads/...` ref, fetches only that ref into fixed local `refs/remotes/atomic-publisher/release-base`, requires the recorded SHA to equal the release commit's sole parent and remain contained in the fetched current remote branch, and passes both expected metadata values to `scripts/verify-release-integrity.ts`. The verifier recreates the release tree with the same stamper and shrinkwrap generator as `scripts/cut-release.ts` and compares Git tree IDs. Every downstream job receives the verified release SHA—not the mutable tag name. Extra, missing, or modified files fail, and the publish job re-resolves the remote tag immediately before GitHub Release creation to reject a force-move. Release docs/Mintlify, shrinkwrap, version/metadata, native, binary/archive, npm tarball, registry, provenance, and GitHub Release checks remain.

Blacksmith's [Actions cache](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-actions) automatically redirects official GitHub and popular third-party cache actions to its colocated backend, but it does not implicitly add a Bun dependency cache or Cargo compilation cache. We intentionally do not cache `node_modules`, Bun's global cache, or Cargo outputs here: measured Linux installs were already 0–1s and Blacksmith notes Rust `sccache` is not redirected to its backend. Cache keys and restore safety would add complexity without a demonstrated bottleneck. [Sticky Disks](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/dependencies-sticky-disks) and [Git checkout caching](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/git-checkout-caching) are optional dashboard/runner features rather than workflow YAML changes; checkout caching is still beta. Dedicated Blacksmith test/smoke jobs use `useblacksmith/checkout@v1`; the mixed native-artifact matrix retains one uniform `actions/checkout` step because it also includes GitHub-hosted Intel macOS.

Blacksmith [Test Analytics](https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-observability/test-analytics) requires uploaded JUnit XML. Bun's current test commands do not produce a repository-standard JUnit artifact, so CI does not add a lossy conversion solely for analytics. The Blacksmith dashboard/run history should continue to be used to validate these savings and identify a future test shard only when suite timings justify it. Runner sizes remain at 4 vCPU for test/smoke work; the measured work is mostly serial, so a larger runner is not assumed to improve it.

### Bounded flaky-test recovery

Only the unit, integration, and coding-agent test-suite steps use `scripts/run-flaky-test-suite.ts`. The green path runs the command once with no artifact writes. After a genuine suite failure, the runner preserves attempt 1, emits an OS/Bun/CPU/memory/load summary, and reruns that same smallest safe suite **once**. If attempt 2 passes, the job succeeds with a visible `Detected flake` warning and step-summary entry; if it fails, the step fails with both logs. `.ci-diagnostics/` is uploaded for 14 days on both Linux and Windows whenever files exist.

This is not a blanket command retry. Typecheck, docs, file-length/lint, builds, native/package/archive checks, shrinkwrap, metadata, provenance, and publishing never use the wrapper. Workflow structure and release-verifier fixtures run first in the separate `test:ci-contracts` step with no retry wrapper; the retry runner's own unit contract is also a no-retry file. Bun does not currently expose a stable cross-platform failed-file manifest suitable for safely reconstructing arbitrary test commands, so the fallback reruns the named suite rather than guessing file paths. The policy adds no second-run cost when CI is green; a recovered flake costs one suite duration and remains observable instead of hiding the instability.

## Pull Request Workflows

### Tests (`test.yml`)

Runs on pushes to `main`, `release/**`, and `prerelease/**`, plus PRs targeting any branch so allowlisted workstream bases receive the same required validation before merge.

Matrix:

- `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` with native `linux-x64` binary smoke coverage
- `blacksmith-4vcpu-windows-2025` with native `windows-x64` binary smoke coverage

Steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Set up Bun.
3. Set up Node 24 (required by the installed-package Node smoke below; the published `atomic` bin runs under `#!/usr/bin/env node` for npm/bun installs).
4. Install dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
5. On Linux, run typecheck, file-length, and docs/Mintlify checks. Unit, native-package, and coding-agent suites continue on both Linux and Windows.
6. Build `@bastani/atomic` and run `bun run test:integration` with `ATOMIC_REQUIRE_INSTALLED_NODE_SMOKE=1` on both platforms. The installed-like layout runs `dist/cli.js --no-session` under **Node**, failing on extension-load diagnostics and preserving the cross-platform npm-install behavior.
7. Build the native release binary with `scripts/build-binaries.sh --skip-install --skip-package-build --platform <native-x64>` so the matrix does not repeat its install or package build.
8. Extract the generated archive, verify required bundled paths, run `atomic --version`, and run `atomic --no-session` far enough to catch extension-load diagnostics while allowing the expected no-models exit.

## Release Pipeline

### Trigger

Creating a valid release tag starts `publish.yml` through GitHub's native `create` event. GitHub only triggers this event workflow when the file exists on the default branch. The integrity job proves the loaded workflow ref is `publish.yml` on that protected default branch, checks out `github.workflow_sha`, and binds the event's tag name and `github.sha` to the remote tag before validating the independently selected release base. Branch-creation events produce a skipped integrity job because publication requires `github.ref_type == 'tag'`.

### Tag Naming

| Tag                                                       | npm tag  | GitHub Release                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (e.g. `0.8.0`)                  | `latest` | normal release, marked latest |
| `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<prerelease>` (e.g. `0.8.0-alpha.1`) | `next`   | prerelease, not marked latest |

`main` and every supported release workstream are **versionless**: their `packages/*/package.json` files stay at the `0.0.0` placeholder. The real version exists only on the tagged `Release <version>` commit produced by `scripts/cut-release.ts`, where the tag matches `packages/coding-agent/package.json` exactly (no leading `v`) and all `packages/*` versions are stamped in sync. `publish.yml` checks out that tagged commit, so its `validate tag matches package.json` gate sees the real version, not the placeholder. The pipeline also refuses to publish the `0.0.0` placeholder if it is ever tagged directly.

### Cutting a release (versionless base)

The selected base never carries a real version, so releasing does not bump it. Instead, `scripts/cut-release.ts` materializes the version on a throwaway `Release <version>` commit whose sole parent is the exact selected remote branch SHA, then tags that commit:

```sh
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.0 --base main --push
bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.0-alpha.1 --base main --push
```

Internally the script validates a clean tree and a short canonical branch name supplied through `--base` (or uses the current attached branch when omitted). It canonicalizes that name to `refs/heads/<base>`, resolves exactly that ref on `origin`, creates a detached `git worktree` at the resulting full SHA, stamps every versioned manifest with `scripts/bump-version.ts` (all `packages/*/package.json`, the `@bastani/atomic-natives` pin, `packages/natives/native/index.js`, and the Cargo manifests/lock), and regenerates `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`. The release commit records `Release-base-ref: refs/heads/<base>` and `Release-base-sha: <full SHA>` trailers before it is tagged. The script removes the worktree and pushes only the tag; the selected base is never advanced by the version stamp. The publisher has no legacy fallback and rejects any release commit missing either trailer. `bun.lock` keeps the base's `0.0.0` workspace placeholders—it is not shipped in the npm tarball and `bun install --frozen-lockfile` tolerates the version-string mismatch.

The release shrinkwrap is prepared before the tag is published. Internal Atomic entries such as `@bastani/atomic-natives` and its generated platform optional packages are derived from the stamped local `package.json` metadata and deterministic npm tarball URLs like `https://registry.npmjs.org/@bastani/atomic-natives/-/atomic-natives-<version>.tgz`; the generator intentionally does not query npm metadata for the just-published native packages or require their registry `integrity` fields.

### Release base allowlist

`refs/heads/main` is always publication-eligible. To publish from another workstream, first protect that branch with the repository's required CI checks, then configure the repository variable `RELEASE_BASE_REFS`. Its value is a comma-separated list of exact canonical full refs, for example `refs/heads/release/workstream-a,refs/heads/prerelease/workstream-b`. Do not include spaces, globs, prefixes, short names such as `release/workstream-a`, remote aliases such as `origin/release/workstream-a`, or tags. Matching is exact and case-sensitive; malformed configured entries and refs absent from the allowlist fail closed. Adding a ref to this variable is the repository administrator's explicit attestation that the branch is an approved, protected release workstream; the publisher verifies commit/ref evidence but does not infer branch policy from its name.

The `publish-release` workflow's existing `base_ref` input remains a short branch name and defaults to `main`. It targets and synchronizes that branch, then invokes `cut-release.ts --base <base_ref>`. For a non-main value, the corresponding canonical `refs/heads/<base_ref>` must already be present in `RELEASE_BASE_REFS`.

### Why npm Publish Before GitHub Release?

npm versions are immutable. The workflow publishes to npm first so the GitHub Release is only created after the npm package is available.

npm provenance currently supports GitHub-hosted runners only, so the final publish job runs on `ubuntu-latest` even though the binary smoke-test and most native-artifact jobs can use Blacksmith runners. The native-artifact matrix follows Blacksmith's architecture-aware runner pattern: Linux x64 uses `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`, Linux arm64 uses `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404-arm`, Darwin arm64 uses `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, and Darwin x64 uses GitHub's Intel macOS runner (`macos-26-intel`) because Blacksmith does not provide Intel macOS runners.

### GitHub Release Creation

GitHub Releases are created with `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`, matching pi's release-action pattern. Release notes are extracted from `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` using a pi-style awk filter on the `## [<version>]` heading.

For prerelease versions (any version containing `-`):

- `prerelease: true`
- `make_latest: false`
- npm tag: `next`

For stable versions:

- `prerelease: false`
- `make_latest: true`
- npm tag: `latest`

Binaries attached to every release:

- `atomic-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-darwin-x64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- `atomic-windows-x64.zip`
- `atomic-windows-arm64.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS`

---

## Publish Package Rule

CI publishes exactly two npm package roots for each release:

- `@bastani/atomic-natives` from `packages/natives`
- `@bastani/atomic` from `packages/coding-agent`

Do not add publish steps for:

- `@bastani/workflows`
- `@bastani/subagents`
- `@bastani/mcp`
- `@bastani/web-access`
- `@bastani/intercom`
- `@bastani/cursor`
- any other `packages/*` workspace

Those extensions are bundled into `@bastani/atomic` by `packages/coding-agent/scripts/copy-builtin-packages.ts`.

---

## No Verdaccio Validation

Verdaccio is intentionally not used.

The meaningful pre-publish checks are split between required PR/base validation and release-specific gates. The release job proves the recorded base SHA is the release commit's sole parent, that this SHA remains contained in the freshly fetched current allowlisted remote branch, and that the release tree is exactly the deterministic release transform. It then checks:

- deterministic `npm-shrinkwrap.json` validation for `@bastani/atomic`
- synchronized tag/package versions and publish metadata
- `@bastani/atomic` build output and builtin extension/resources
- all native packages and six release archives
- `bun pm pack --dry-run` and npm OIDC provenance

## Release Checklist

1. Choose the short release base name (default `main`). Move the `[Unreleased]` section in `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` to `## [0.8.0] - <YYYY-MM-DD>` and land it on that base like any normal change. The publish workflow uses this section as the GitHub Release body. **Do not bump any `package.json` version—the release base is versionless.** For a non-main base, configure its exact canonical ref in `RELEASE_BASE_REFS` before cutting the release.

2. Run local validation (optional; required PR/base CI already covers it on the integrated parent):

    ```sh
    bun run typecheck
    bun run check:file-length
    cd packages/coding-agent && bun run docs:check
    cd docs && bunx --bun mintlify@latest validate
    bunx --bun mintlify@latest broken-links
    cd ..
    bun run build
    cd ../..
    bun run test:unit
    bun run test:integration
    ./scripts/build-binaries.sh --platform linux-x64
    tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
    tar -xzf packages/coding-agent/binaries/atomic-linux-x64.tar.gz -C "$tmpdir"
    "$tmpdir/atomic/atomic" --version
    set +e
    output=$(printf '' | "$tmpdir/atomic/atomic" --no-session 2>&1)
    status=$?
    set -e
    echo "$output"
    if grep -q 'Failed to load extension' <<<"$output"; then
      exit 1
    fi
    if [ "$status" -ne 0 ] && ! grep -Eq 'No models available|No model selected|No API key found' <<<"$output"; then
      exit "$status"
    fi
    rm -rf "$tmpdir"
    ```

    On Windows, substitute `--platform windows-x64`, extract `atomic-windows-x64.zip`, and run `atomic.exe --version` plus the equivalent `atomic.exe --no-session` smoke. (A versionless base build reports the `0.0.0` placeholder for `--version`; a release build from the tag reports the real version.)

3. From a clean selected base, cut and push the release tag. This stamps the version onto a detached `Release 0.8.0` commit at the exact remote base SHA, regenerates the deterministic `@bastani/atomic` shrinkwrap from local metadata, records immutable base metadata, tags it, and pushes only the tag. Tag creation automatically starts the protected publish workflow from the default branch.

    ```sh
    bun run scripts/cut-release.ts 0.8.0 --base main --push
    ```

    Omit `--push` to inspect the tag locally first (`git show 0.8.0`, `git log --oneline -1 0.8.0`), then `git push origin 0.8.0`. The selected base is never advanced by the version stamp.

    For a non-main workstream, substitute its short branch name for `main` and first add its exact canonical `refs/heads/<base>` value to `RELEASE_BASE_REFS`. Before pushing, inspect `git show -s --format=%B <version>` and require exactly one matching `Release-base-ref` and `Release-base-sha`; the latter must be the release commit's sole parent. The protected publisher rechecks both values against the current remote branch.

4. Inspect the resulting `Release tag 0.8.0` and `Publish 0.8.0` runs. Do not dispatch another workflow, use `--watch`, or add sleep/poll loops. The protected publish run pins one verified commit SHA across every job, runs docs/Mintlify and all release-specific gates, cross-compiles binaries, publishes `@bastani/atomic-natives` and `@bastani/atomic` with npm OIDC provenance, and creates the GitHub Release. If a run is still active, return later or rely on GitHub notifications rather than holding a runner or agent stage open.

For prereleases, substitute `0.8.0-alpha.1`. The repository-local `publish-release` Atomic workflow uses the same event-driven path and returns a resumable blocked result when PR checks or publishing are still pending; it never waits, sleeps, polls, or dispatches another workflow.
