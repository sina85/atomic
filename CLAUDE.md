# Development Rules

## Overview

This repo is the private `atomic-monorepo` Bun workspace. It currently houses:

- `@bastani/atomic` in `packages/coding-agent` — the Atomic-branded fork of pi's coding-agent CLI and the only independently published package.
- `@bastani/workflows` in `packages/workflows` — a first-party extension for Atomic/pi that brings multi-stage, DAG-driven workflow execution to agent sessions.
- `@bastani/subagents` in `packages/subagents` — builtin subagent orchestration, reusable agent definitions, skills, prompts, chains, and TUI clarification support.
- `@bastani/mcp` in `packages/mcp` — builtin MCP adapter extension that exposes MCP servers as agent tools.
- `@bastani/web-access` in `packages/web-access` — builtin web search, URL fetching, GitHub repository, PDF, and video extraction tools.
- `@bastani/intercom` in `packages/intercom` — builtin coordination channel for parent/child and cross-session agent communication.

Companion packages under `packages/*` ship as **raw TypeScript** (no compile step) and are bundled into `@bastani/atomic` at build time rather than published independently. The coding-agent package follows upstream pi's compiled-package layout.

## Tech Stack

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3.14** for the runtime, package manager, and test runner
- TypeScript ≥ 5.x (strict, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`)
- `bun:test` + `node:assert/strict` for tests
- `@sinclair/typebox` for schema definitions
- `jiti` for runtime TS loading where needed

## Quick Reference

### Commands

Default to using **Bun**, not Node/npm/yarn/pnpm.

- Use `bun <file.ts>` instead of `node --experimental-strip-types <file.ts>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test <path>` instead of `node --test` or Jest/Vitest CLIs
- Use `bun run typecheck` to run TypeScript type checks (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Repo commands: `bun run test:unit`, `bun run test:integration`, `bun run test:all`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run hooks:install`, `bun run hooks:run`
- Git hooks are configured in `prek.toml`; `bun install` runs the root `prepare` script to install hooks with `prek install --prepare-hooks` using `default_install_hook_types`.

**Exception — publishing:** `npm publish --provenance` is still the registry publish tool because npm's OIDC-signed provenance lives in the npm CLI. Everything else is Bun.

## Best Practices

- Avoid ambiguous types like `any` and `unknown`. Use specific types instead.
- Source files use `.js` import extensions (TypeScript ESM convention). The repo ships as `.ts` files; Bun resolves `.js` specifiers to the underlying `.ts` source directly — no loader hook required. atomic's loader follows the same convention as pi.
- Do not add a build step (`dist/`, `tsconfig.build.json`, etc.) to `packages/workflows`; it distributes raw TypeScript and the host loads it directly. `packages/coding-agent` is copied from upstream pi and keeps its existing build setup.
- When using skills, if you see a frontmatter of `metadata: internal` set to `true` (if missing assume `false`), that means the skill is for internal developers of this package. If this flag is omitted, the skill is meant for consumers/everyday users.

## Design Context

Refer to `.impeccable.md`

## Testing

Use `bun run test:unit` (or `test:integration`, `test:all`) and make use of your tdd skill to write high quality tests. Tests use `bun:test` + `node:assert/strict`:

```ts#test/unit/index.test.ts
import { test } from "bun:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";

test("hello world", () => {
  assert.equal(1, 1);
});
```

### Hook name compatibility

Bun's `bun:test` exports `beforeAll`/`afterAll` (not `before`/`after`). Use `beforeAll`/`afterAll` for once-per-suite setup/teardown and `beforeEach`/`afterEach` for per-test hooks.

### AI Agent Integration

When using Bun’s test runner with AI coding assistants, you can enable quieter output to improve readability and reduce context noise. This feature minimizes test output verbosity while preserving essential failure information.
​
**Environment Variables**

Set any of the following environment variables to enable AI-friendly output:
`CLAUDECODE=1` - For Claude Code
`REPL_ID=1` - For Replit
`AGENT=1` - Generic AI agent flag

### Code Quality

- Frequently run linters and type checks using `bun run lint` and `bun run typecheck` (both are `tsc --noEmit`).
- Avoid `any` and `unknown` types.
- Modularize code and avoid re-inventing the wheel. Use functionality of libraries and SDKs whenever possible.

## Debugging

You are bound to run into errors when testing. As you test and run into issues/edge cases, address issues in a file you create called `issues.md` to track progress and support future iterations. Delegate to the debugging sub-agent for support. Delete the file when all issues are resolved to keep the repository clean.

### Coding Agent Configuration Location

atomic:

- global:
    - Linux/MacOS: `~/.atomic/agent/`
    - Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\.atomic\agent\\`
- extensions: `~/.atomic/agent/extensions/<name>/`
- local: `.atomic/` in the project directory

**Agent Skill Locations** - local: - `.agents/skills` (`.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`) - global: - `~/.agents/skills` for OpenCode and Copilot CLI - `~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code

## Releasing

Atomic mirrors pi's tag-driven release flow: bump versions locally, commit, push a `<version>` git tag (no leading `v`, for example `0.8.24` or `0.8.24-alpha.1`), and CI publishes to npm with OIDC provenance and creates the GitHub Release with cross-compiled binaries attached.

### Agent publishing requests

If a user asks you to publish the package or create a release/prerelease:

1. Ask the user with the `ask_user_question`/ask-question tool what version to publish if they have not supplied a version.
2. Ask whether they want a release or prerelease if that cannot be inferred from the supplied version, or if the version is in an incorrect format. Valid formats are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for releases and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.REVISION` (revision starts at 1) for prereleases.
3. Create a branch using the naming convention: `[prerelease | release]/<version>` (no leading `v`) where `[prerelease | release]` changes depending on whether the version if a release or prerelease version.
4. Follow the guidance in the "Changelog" section to update the `CHANGELOG.md` files.
5. Follow the "Bumping Versions" guidance to correctly bump the package version.
6. Commit all unstaged changes in the current branch.
7. Create a PR to merge the branch to main.
8. Wait to make sure all of the CI checks pass using the `gh` tool.
9. Auto-merge when all CI checks pass. If the checks don't pass, ask the user what they want to do using the `ask_user_question` tool.
10. If/when the branch is merged to main, switch back to main, and pull the latest changes from `origin/main`.
11. A branch push or PR merge alone does not publish, so if all the steps above succeed, create the new release by creating a git tag with: `git tag <version>` and push it with `git push origin <version>`.
12. Wait for the release to finish and monitor the status of the publish action. If the publish checks don't pass, ask the user what they want to do using the `ask_user_question` tool. Otherwise, provide a summary to the user.

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (each package has its own)

### Format

Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules

- Before adding entries, read the full `[Unreleased]` section to see which subsections already exist
- New entries ALWAYS go under `## [Unreleased]` section
- Append to existing subsections (e.g., `### Fixed`), do not create duplicates
- NEVER modify already-released version sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`)
- Each version section is immutable once released

### Attribution

- **Internal changes (from issues)**: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/123))`
- **External contributions**: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Bumping Versions

Use the top-level `scripts/bump-version.ts` script to update every `packages/*/package.json` version and package README badge:

```sh
# Explicit version
bun run scripts/bump-version.ts 0.1.0
bun run scripts/bump-version.ts 0.1.0-alpha.1
```

Run `bun install` afterward to refresh `bun.lock`.

## CI

An overview of CI is described here: [CI Docs](docs/ci.md).

Note: Remember that npm publishing with provenance does NOT require a token. That's the whole point. So if you see any steps in the CI related to setting up npm tokens (e.g., NPM_TOKEN|NODE_AUTH_TOKEN) for publishing, those are likely mistakes and should be removed.

## Tips

1. The workflows extension is bundled into `@bastani/atomic`. For local development against upstream pi, symlink `packages/workflows` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/workflows` if you want host-level discovery outside Atomic.
2. Rely on agent skills to provide information on best practices during implementation. Here is a short list of Agent Skills that are incredibly relevant to this project that you should try to use when applicable:
    - typescript-advanced-types
    - typescript-expert
    - typescript-react-reviewer
    - tdd
    - impeccable
3. Ask for clarity if you are unsure about a change. The developer is your best friend and oftentimes can clarify intent.
4. When modifying this extension, follow pi's extension and SDK conventions.

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
This repo uses **Bun (≥ 1.3.14)** for development, scripts, and tests. Do NOT use `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` for development commands. Always use `bun`, `bunx`, and `bun run`. The only acceptable exception is `npm publish --provenance` for the release flow (OIDC provenance is npm-CLI-specific).

`@bastani/workflows` ships raw `.ts` files with no build step — do NOT introduce `dist/`, `tsconfig.build.json`, `outDir`, or any bundling. Tests run via Bun's built-in `bun:test` runner.
