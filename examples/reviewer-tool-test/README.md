# reviewer-tool-test

Custom reviewer tool wiring on the Copilot SDK — defines a Zod-validated `defineTool` and exposes it inside a stage as the only allowed tool.

> Copilot only — Claude and OpenCode have their own tool-definition shapes covered elsewhere.

## Run

```bash
bun install
bun run copilot-worker.ts
```

## What's here

- `copilot/` — workflow that registers the reviewer tool
- `copilot-worker.ts` — Commander entrypoint
