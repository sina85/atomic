# multi-workflow

Two Claude workflows (`hello`, `goodbye`) under a single `cli.ts`. Uses `listWorkflows(registry)` to register one Commander subcommand per workflow, with each workflow's declared inputs mounted as `--<flag>` options.

## Run

```bash
bun install
bun run cli.ts hello   --who=Alex
bun run cli.ts goodbye --tone=melodramatic
bun run cli.ts --help
```

## What's here

- `hello/`, `goodbye/` — two independent Claude workflows
- `cli.ts` — single Commander entrypoint that dispatches by workflow name

This is the shape to use when one CLI needs to expose multiple workflows. For the variant where the same dispatcher spans agents (claude/copilot/opencode), reach for the `-a/--agent` flag — see the atomic CLI's builtin registry for an example.
