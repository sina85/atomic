# hil-favorite-color-headless

HIL pause inside a **headless** stage — the agent escalates from no-pane mode into an interactive prompt only when it needs human input.

## Run

```bash
bun install
bun run claude-worker.ts
bun run copilot-worker.ts
bun run opencode-worker.ts
```

## What's here

- `claude/`, `copilot/`, `opencode/` — workflow definitions per agent
- `<agent>-worker.ts` — Commander entrypoint

Compare with `hil-favorite-color/` — same flow, but the question is asked from a stage that ran headless until the prompt arrived.
