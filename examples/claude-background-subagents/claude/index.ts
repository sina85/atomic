/**
 * Two-stage Claude workflow that exercises the in-flight subagent gating.
 *
 * Stage 1 ("dispatch") asks Claude to spawn three independent **background**
 * subagents via the `Agent` tool with `run_in_background: true`. Each
 * subagent waits a few seconds and writes a marker file under
 * `/tmp/atomic-bg-<n>.txt`, then returns. Claude is told NOT to wait for
 * them — its main turn ends right after dispatching.
 *
 * Stage 2 ("verify") reads the three marker files and confirms they all
 * exist with non-empty content. If the harness advanced to stage 2 before
 * the backgrounded subagents finished, the marker files would be missing
 * and the assertion fails.
 *
 * Without the in-flight gating, this example surfaces the bug
 * deterministically: stage 2 starts before the subagents finish and either
 * (a) reads missing files, or (b) intermittently hits
 * `tmux respawn-pane: fork failed: Device not configured` due to FD pressure
 * on the atomic tmux server. With the gating, stage 1's Stop hook holds
 * until all three SubagentStop events fire and the in-flight marker dir
 * empties; only then does stage 2 spawn.
